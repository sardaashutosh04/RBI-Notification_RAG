It has since been decided \nthat the Reserve Bank may also consider scheme of transfer of assets and liabilities \n(including branches) of UCBs to commercial banks with DICGC support in legacy cases, as an additional option for resolu tion of weak banks, where proposals for \namalgamation within the UCB sector were not forthcoming. The scheme should \nensure 100 per cent protection to depositor s and DICGC support would be restricted \nto the amount provided under Section 16(2) of the DICGC Act, 1961. The UCB \nconcerned should have negative net wort h as on March 31, 2007 or earlier and \ncontinues to have negative net wo rth as on the date of transfer. \n  \n2. The guidelines for transfer of assets and liabilities of UCBs to commercial banks are \ngiven in Annex I.

Eligibility \n \n1.1   The transfer of assets and liabiliti es of UCBs to commercial banks with DICGC \nsupport may be considered by the Reserve Bank  in legacy cases, i.e. in case of \nUCBs, whose net worth was assessed negative through st atutory inspections with \nreference to their financial position as  on March 31, 2007 or earlier and which \ncontinue to have negative net wort h as on the date of transfer.  \n \n1.2   The UCB concerned should be register ed either in a State, which has signed \nMOU with the Reserve Bank or under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act, \n2002, where RCS/CRCS concerned assures to order such transfers in public \ninterest.  \n \n1.3   The proposals may be considered w here the transferee bank has obtained \nregulatory approval for the same. \n \n2. Essential conditions \n \n2.1 Audit-cum-Due diligence \nThe audit-cum-due diligence should be carried out in respect of the transferor bank with reference to the financia l position as at the clos e of business of the day \nimmediately preceding the effective date of  transfer. For this purpose, independent \nauditors (chartered accountants) may be appointed by the transferee bank with the \nconcurrence of DICGC. \n \n2.2 Valuation of assets & liabilities  \n \nThe valuations of assets and liabilities of the transfero r bank should be as per the \nguidelines given in Annex II. The assets should be grouped in to two categories, viz. \nreadily realizable (hereafter called as \u201creadily realizable assets\u201d) and non-readily \nrealizable (hereafter called as \u201cnon-readily  realizable assets\u201d).  Loans and advances \nwhich are \u2018standard\u2019 assets and \u2018substandard\u2019 assets will be classified as \u2018readily \n 3realizable\u2019 assets and loans and advances  which are \u2018doubtful\u2019 assets and \u2018loss\u2019 \nassets will be classified as \u2018 non-readily realizable\u2019 assets. \n \n2.3 Deposit coverage ratio  \n \n2.3.1 The scheme of transfer should pr ovide the proportion of deposits of the \ntransferor bank, which will be taken over by  the transferee bank out  of the \u2018\u2019readily \nrealizable assets\u2019\u2019 of the transferor bank  and from its own initial contribution, \nhereafter referred to as \u201ddeposit coverage ra tio\u201d. The deposit cove rage ratio shall not \nbe less than 65 per cent. Higher deposit coverage ratio may be insisted upon \ndepending upon the RBI assessment. \n \n2.3.2 The \u201cdeposit coverage ratio\u201d may be worked out in the following manner: \n \n(a) The amount due to prefe rred and secured creditors s hould be deducted from the \n\u201creadily realizable assets\u201d, to determine the \u201cnet readily realizable asset\u201d. Similarly, \nthe amount due to preferred and secured credi tors should be deducted from the total \noutside liabilities (i.e. the sum of the total liabilities  to depositors and all other \ncreditors, including provisions for expenses, taxes, etc.) to arri ve at \u201cnet outside \nliabilities\u201d.  \n \n(b) The \u201cnet readily realizable assets\u201d (say x) plus the amount of initial contribution to \nbe made by the transferee bank (say y) divided by the \u201cnet amount of outside \nliabilities\u201d (say z), may be called the \u201cdepos it coverage ratio\u201d [(say x + y) / z].  \n \n2.4 Protection for depositors whose de posits are upto Rs. One lakh   \nThe scheme should provide for 100 per cent protection to the depositors whose deposits are upto Rs. One lakh out of the net readily realizable assets, initial \ncontribution made by the transferee bank and support from DICGC. Accordingly, to the extent of the deposit coverage  ratio, the deposits will be taken over by the \ntransferee bank and for the balance DICGC wil l make payment in accordance with \nparagraph 2.6 below. \n \n2.5    Protection for depositors whose deposits exceed Rs. One lakh \n \nIn respect of depositors whose deposits exc eed Rs. One lakh, deposits to the extent \nof the deposit coverage rati o will be taken over by the transferee bank and DICGC \nwill make payment in accordance with par a 2.6 below.  The excess of deposits \nremaining after the deposits taken over by the transferee bank and the DICGC \n 4payment will be paid or pr ovided for by the transferee bank by an additional \ncontribution. \n \n2.6 Claims on DICGC \n \nDICGC may pay to the deposit ors to the extent and in the manner prescribed under \nSection 16(2) of the DICGC Ac t, 1961. Only in respect of the insured depositors, the \ntransferee bank may lodge claim with DICG C for the amount equivalent to the \ndifference between (a) the balance in deposit accounts of each depositor up to Rs \nOne lakh or Rs. One lakh in case the balance exceeds Rs One lakh and (b) amount \npaid or credited to every such depositor as per the deposit coverage ratio specified in the scheme, on the date on which t he scheme comes into force (a-b). \n \n2.7 Protection for preferred and secured creditor \n \nThe liabilities to preferr ed and secured creditors will be fully taken over by the \ntransferee bank. \n \n2.8 Protection for unsecured creditors (other than depositors) \n \nIn respect of unsecured creditors (other than depositors), all liabilities will be taken \nover by transferee bank by an additional contribution.  \n \n2.9 Sharing of the recoveries from  \u201cnon readily realizable assets\u201d \n \nAll recoveries against \u2018non-readily realiz able\u2019 assets will be kept in a separate \n\u2018collection\u2019 account.  As per provisions of the DICGC Act, 1961 and the DICGC \nGeneral Regulations, 1961, t he transferee bank shall repa y the amount paid by the \nCorporation out of recoveries  made from non readily realiz able assets after making \nprovision for expenses in respect of such  realizations. Though the Corporation has \npriority in appropriation of recoveries out of non readily realizable assets, it may \nconsider sharing the recoveries from th e \u201cnon readily realizable assets\u201d net of \nexpenses with the tran sferee bank, keeping in view the financial contribution made \nby the transferee bank. If any balance rema ins after settling the claims of DICGC \nand the transferee bank, the same will be distributed pro-rata among the \nshareholders of the transferor bank. \n \n3. Operational procedures \n \nThe transferor and the transferee bank may be guided by the oper ational procedures \nlaid down vide circular PCB.Cir.36/ 09.169.00/04-05 dated Febr uary 2, 2005.  \n******** \n 5 \nAnnex II \n \nGuidelines for valuation of assets & liab ilities in case of transfer of assets and \nliabilities of Urban Cooperative Banks to commercial banks  \n \nThe independent auditors ( Chartered Accountants ) appointed by the transferee bank \nwith the concurrence of DICGC should value the assets and reckon the liabilities of \nthe transferor bank in accordanc e with the followin g provisions: \n \n1. Cash & bank balances \n \nCash & bank balances are to be reckon ed at their book value unless there is \nreasonable doubt about the repayment of deposits by t he banks with which such \nbalances are held.

Investments \n \ni) Investments including Government securi ties shall be valued at the market rates \nprevailing on the day immediately preceding the date of merger or  at the rate as \nprescribed by Reserve Bank of  India under investment gui delines, provided that the \nsecurities of the Central Government such  as Post Office Certificates, Treasury \nSavings Deposit Certificates and  any other securities or ce rtificates issued under the \nSmall Saving Scheme of the Central Governm ent shall be valued at their face value \nor the encashable value as on the date of merger, whichever is higher. \n \nii) Where the market value of any Gove rnment Security such as the Zamindari \nAbolition Bonds or other  similar security in respect of which the Principal is payable \nin installments, is not ascert ainable or is for any reason  not considered reflecting the \nfair value thereof or as otherwise appropriate, the security shall be valued at such an \namount as is considered reasonable having r egard to the installm ents of principal \nand interest remaining to be paid, the per iod during which such  installments are \npayable, the yield of any security issued by the Govt., to which the security pertains \nand having the same or approxim ately the same maturity an d other relevant factors. \n \niii) Where the market value of any secu rity, share, debenture, bond or other \ninvestment is not considered reasonable by reason of its having been affected by \n 6abnormal factors, the invest ment may be valued as per the extant valuation \nguidelines endorsed by Reserve Bank of India. \n \niv) Where the market value of any security, share, debenture, bond or other \ninvestment is not ascertainable,  only such value, if any, shall be taken into account \nas is considered reasonable, having regard to the financial posi tion of the issuing \nconcern, the dividends paid by  it during the preceding five  years and other relevant \nfactors and neither the transferor bank nor  the transferee bank shall question the \nsaid valuation as from the date of the merger.  \n \n3. Loans & advances \n \nThe loans and advances including bills purchased and discounted will be classified as per existing prudential norms as \u2018s tandard\u2019, \u2018sub-standard\u2019, \u2018doubtful\u2019 and \u2018loss\u2019 \nassets and the appropriate provisions ma de there against.  \u2018Standard\u2019 assets and \n\u2018sub-standard\u2019 assets will be co nsidered as \u2018readily realiz able\u2019 assets and \u2018doubtful\u2019 \nassets and \u2018loss\u2019 assets wi ll be considered as \u2018non-readi ly realizable\u2019 assets.  All \nloans and advances will be valued at their book value net  of the provisions created \nthere against. \n \n4. Furniture & fixtures \n \nFurniture and fixtures, com puter, all related hardware a nd peripherals etc. stationery \nin stock and other assets, if any, shall be  valued at the wri tten down value as per \nbooks or the realizable value as may be cons idered reasonable, whichever is lower.  \n \n5. Premises & immovable properties \n \nPremises and all other  immovable properties and any a ssets acquired in satisfaction \nof claims shall be valued at their market value. \n \n6.  Other assets \n \nAll other assets will be valued at the lower of their book value or  realizable value. \n \n7. Liabilities \n \nLiabilities for purpose of this scheme shall include all contingent liabilities, which the \ntransferee bank may reasonably be expected or required to meet after the said date \nof merger.  \n******** \n 7Annex III \nIncentives to transferee banks  \n \nThe Reserve Bank may consider the fo llowing incentives to the transferee \n(commercial) bank in case of transfer  of assets and liabilities of UCBs. \n \nThe transferee bank may be permitted to take  over the branches and close down the \nloss incurring branches (net loss for last  three years) of the transferor bank with the \nprior approval of Reserve Bank of India (DBOD).  The shifting / relocation of the \nbranches of the transferor bank may also be permitted by RBI (DBOD) subject to \nmaking the banking facilities available to the customers through the existing / \nrelocated branches of the transferor / tr ansferee bank.  The transferee bank should \nsubmit a detailed proposal for taking ov er and rationalization of the acquired \nbranches of the concerned UCBs. \n \n******** \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/IRMCB240210.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Feb 24, 2010", "info": "RESERVE BANK OF INDIA \nForeign Exchange Department \nCentral Office \nMumbai - 400 001 \nRBI/2009-10/36 \nA.P.

During the period April-December 2009, clearing \nhouses in the country have processed on an average around 4.5 million cheques every \nday. Several measures have been initiated by Reserve Bank of India to ensure that this retail payment product functions in a safe and efficient manner.   \n \n2. Introduction of Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology during the mid-\neighties has been the single-most important development responsible for making the \ncheque clearing popular and efficient \u2013 volume-wise, speed-wise and convenience-wise. At the banks\u2019 end too, cheques in MICR format have facilitated post-processing ease in operations, affording credit to customer accounts and reducing reconciliation issues, thus improving customer service. Standardisation of cheque forms (leaves) in terms of size, MICR band, quality of paper, etc., was one of the key factors that enabled \nmechanisation of cheque processing. \n \n3. Over a period of time, banks have added a variety of patterns and design of cheque \nforms to aid segmentation, branding, identification, etc., as also incorporated therein a number of security features to reduce the incidence of cheque misuse, tampering, \nalterations, etc. Growing use of multi-city and payable-at-par cheques for handling of \ncheques at any branches of a bank, introduction of Cheque Truncation System (CTS) at New Delhi for image-based cheque processing, increasing popularity of Speed Clearing for local processing of outstation cheques, etc., are a few aspects that led to looking into the need, if any, for prescription of certain minimum security features in cheques printed, issued and handled by banks and customers unifo rmly across the banking industry.  \n  \n4. Against the above backdrop, a Working Group was set-up by the Reserve Bank of India for examining further standardisation of cheque forms and enhancement of security features therein. The Working Group comprised various stakeholders viz. commercial banks, paper manufacturers, security printers, etc., apart from Reserve Bank of India. \nRecommendations of the Working Group were discussed internally as also forwarded to \nIndian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA), National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and select banks for their views. The feedback from these institutions has been received and duly considered. \n \n5. It has since been decided to prescribe certain benchmarks towards achieving \nstandardisation of cheques issued by banks across the country. These include  provision  \nof   mandatory   minimum   security  features   on   cheque  forms  like  quality  of  paper, \nwatermark, bank\u2019s logo in invisible ink, void pantograph, etc., and standardisation of field \nplacements on cheques. In addition, certain desirable features are also being suggested which could be implemented by banks based on their need and risk perception. The set \nof minimum security features would not only ensure uniformity across all cheque forms \nissued by banks in the country but also help presenting banks while scrutinising / recognising cheques of drawee banks in an image-based processing scenario. The homogeneity in security features is expected to act as a deterrent against cheque frauds, \nwhile the standardisation of field plac ements on cheque forms would enable straight-\nthrough-processing by use of optical / image character recognition technology.  \n \n6. The benchmark prescriptions shall be known as \" CTS-2010 standard \", specifications \nof which are annexed. Effective date of implementation of the standard will be advised to you in due course. It is our intention that the revised cheque standard is implemented by banks before the roll-out of CTS at Chennai. IBA and NPCI will be co-ordinating and advising banks on introduction of additional security features on cheques as also other \naspects relating to implementation of the standard across the country. \n \n7.

The instructions \nas above were issued by us pursuant  to the recommendations of the High \nLevel Group constituted under DG(UT)  to look into various currency \nmanagement practices in vogue. \n \n2.  The Group, inter alia, has also recommended setting up of Cash Processing Centres (CPCs) at va rious key locations with enhanced \nprocessing and storage capacit ies to tap advantages arising out of economies \nof scale, minimize overnight cash risks at bank branches and  to benefit from \nsophisticated logistics techniques. \n \n3.

Currently \noperational at most locations across the length and breadth of the country, Clearing \nHouses facilitate multilateral net clearing and settlement of over four million cheques \neveryday on a T + 1 basis. In fact, the pr ocessing cycle in India for local cheques \nencompasses both the presentation and return clearing legs, and compares \nfavourably with similar systems around the world. \n2. During the recent annua l financial inspection of a bank, our Department of \nBanking Supervision had observed that the bank had entered into bilateral \nagreements with other banks for processing and clearing of post dated cheques \n(PDCs) deposited with it and pa yable by the other banks.  Under the agreement, the \nbank was sending such PDCs directly to the other bank for realisation and receiving \nproceeds thereof by credit to  its current account opened wit h the other bank. Similar \nfacility was extended to the other bank for cl earing PDCs drawn on this bank as well. \nOn our enquiring with a few ot her banks, it is ascertained that a number of similar \nbilateral agreements exist between /among banks and in the proc ess, significant \nvolume of instruments was getting ex changed and cleared outside the Clearing \nHouse infrastructure.  \n3. After a detailed review we have conclu ded that such agreements (also styled as \ncorresponding banking arrangements by so me banks) undermine the existence and \nneed of Clearing Houses and do not in any way contribute to the efficiency of the \nclearing system. In fact, t he banks incur higher costs and take longer time to clear \nthe cheques bilaterally. The parallel cl earing arrangements vitiate the Clearing \nHouse rules, standard, minimum benchmarks and uniform practices. Malpractices and disputes between banks can exacerbate into systemic concerns. \nMumbai 400 001 \nTel: 2260 1000 Fax : 2262 1011/2261 0943/2261 0948  E-mail : cgmincrpcd@rbi.org.in  \n \n 2 \n \n4. Further, bilateral clearing arrangements attract provisions of the Payment and \nSettlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act) and the regulations framed thereunder. Section \n2 (i) of the Act defines a payment system as a \u2018system that enables payment to be \neffected between a payer and a beneficiary , involving clearing, payment or \nsettlement service or all of  them, but does not include a stock exchange\u2019. Section 4 \n(1) of the Act stipulates that \u2018no per son other than the Reserve Bank shall \ncommence or operate a payment system ex cept under and in accordance with an \nauthorisation issued by the Reserve Bank under provisions  of the Act\u2019. Operators of \nsuch payment systems are required to seek authorisation under the Act, within six \nmonths of the commencement of the Act i.e. by Februar y 12, 2009. The bilateral \narrangements between banks being inter-bank in  nature fall within the ambit of \npayment systems and requi re authorisation from the Reserve Bank. \n5. Bilateral agreements include corres pondent banking arrangem ents, arrangements \nunder cash management services, or any  arrangement that envisages routine \nclearing of cheques drawn on ei ther or both banks without routing them through the \nClearing House infrastructure as also agreements for sharing of ATMs, use of \nelectronic clearing products like ECS or  any such payment system products. \nContinuation or commencement of bilateral clearing arrangements without \nauthorisation is violative of the provisions of the Act and would invite strict penal \naction as provided under the Act. Keeping in vi ew the various risks involved, all State \nand Central Co-operative banks are advised to immediately discontinue all bilateral \nclearing arrangements arising out of  normal banking transactions.  \n6.

(DIR Series) Circular No .35 dated February 17, 2010) \n \nACM \n \nMEMORANDUM OF PROCEDURE FOR CHANNELING \nTRANSACTIONS THROUGH ASIAN CLEARING UNION \n \n1. Introduction \n \nThis edition of the Memor andum details the revised pr ocedure to be followed by \nthe AD Category-I banks for handling transactions to be cleared through Asian \nClearing Union (ACU). \n \n2. Handling of ACU Transactions \n \nAll transactions to be cleared through the ACU will be handled by AD Category-I \nbanks in the same manner as other norma l foreign exchange transactions. All AD \nCategory-I banks in India have been permitted to handle ACU transactions. AD Category-I banks may freely enter into  correspondent arrangem ents with banks in \nthe other countries participat ing in the Clearing Union. \n \n3. Eligible Instruments of Payment \n \nThe Asian Monetary Units (A MUs) is the common unit of account of ACU and be \ndenominated as \u2018ACU Dollar\u2019 and \u2018ACU Euro\u2019,  which shall be equivalent in value \nto one US Dollar and one Euro, respectively . All instruments of payment shall be \ndenominated in AMUs. Settlement of such  instruments may be made by AD \nCategory-I banks through oper ation on ACU Dollar and ACU Euro Accounts. \n \n4. ACU Dollar Accounts and ACU Euro Accounts \n \n(i) The essence of the procedure for settlement of eligible transactions \nthrough the ACU is that a large part of  the transactions, as possible, should \nbe settled directly through the account s maintained by AD Category-I \nbanks with banks in the other partici pating countries and vice versa; only \nthe spill-overs in either direction being  required to be settled by the Central \nBanks in the countries concerned through the Clearing Union. \n \n 2(ii)      AD Category-I banks are permi tted to settle commercial and other eligible \ntransactions in much the same manner  as other normal foreign exchange \ntransactions. The procedures for opening letters of credit, negotiation of \ndocuments, etc., in respect of trades in convertible currencies are \napplicable for trades routed through the ACU mechanism. \n \n(iii)       To facilitate settlement of transactions through the ACU in this manner, AD \nCategory-I banks may freely open with  their branches/correspondents \n\u2018ACU Dollar\u2019 and 'ACU Euro\u2019 accounts. These must be kept distinct from \nU.S. Dollar and Euro accounts res pectively, if any, maintained for \nsettlement of transactions taking plac e outside the Clearing Union. The \nterms ACU Dollar and ACU Euro are s pecifically being used in order to \nidentify the use of U.S. Dollar and Euro respectively in relation to ACU transactions. Otherwise, there is no di stinction, value- wise, between ACU \nDollar and the U.S. Dollar and between ACU Euro and Euro. \n \n(iv)    AD Category-I banks should ens ure that at all times the balances \nmaintained in the ACU Dollar and A CU Euro accounts are commensurate \nwith the requirements of their no rmal exchange business and funds \nrendered surplus should be repa triated to India regularly. \n \n5. Mechanism for settlement through the Union \n \n(i)      The Reserve Bank has been un dertaking to receive and pay U.S. Dollars, \neffective 1st January 1996 and Euros, effective 1st January 2009, from/to \nAD Category-I banks for the purpose of  funding or for repatriating the \nexcess liquidity in the ACU Dollar and ACU Euro accounts respectively, maintained by the AD Category-I ban ks with their correspondents in the \nother participating countries. Similarly, the Reserve Bank has also been receiving and delivering U.S. Dollar   and Euro amounts for absorbing \nliquidity or for funding the ACU Doll ar (vostro) and ACU Euro (vostro) \naccounts  respectively, maintained by the AD Category-I banks on behalf of their overseas correspondents. \n \n(ii)       Funding of ACU Dollar and ACU Euro account maintained with a \ncorrespondent bank in another  ACU participant country  will continue to be \n 3effected by the Reserve Bank only a fter receiving an in timation that \nequivalent amount of  U.S. Dollar and Euro is bei ng credited to its account \nwith the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, and its account \nwith the Deutsche Bundesban k, Frankfurt respectively, by the AD \nCategory-I bank on the value date. Similarly, Reserve Bank will continue to arrange for payment of US Dollar and  Euro from its accounts with the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New Yo rk, New York and the Deutsche \nBundesbank, Frankfurt respectively, to the account of the correspondent of the AD Category-I bank, in case it has  received intimation of surrender of \nsurplus funds to the other participant  Central Bank on behalf of the AD \nCategory-I bank in India. \n \n(iii)      In the case of funding of ACU Dollar and ACU Euro accounts maintained \nby foreign commercial banks with the AD Category-I banks in India, Reserve Bank on receipt of an advice from participant Central Bank will \narrange to credit U.S. Dollar and Euro  amounts to the Nostro Accounts of \nthe AD Category-I banks. The AD Category-I banks will credit the U.S. \nDollar and Euro amounts to the AC U Dollar and ACU Euro accounts \nrespectively, of the foreign commercial  banks of the participating countries \nconcerned on the value date. Similarl y, the AD Category-I banks will \nreceive instructions from their overseas correspondents to surrender \nexcess liquidity in their ACU Dollar and ACU Euro accounts to the Reserve \nBank. In such cases the AD Category- I banks will have to actually remit the \nU.S. Dollar and Euro am ounts to the account of Reserve Bank with the \nFederal Reserve Bank of  New York, New York and Deutsche Bundesbank, \nFrankfurt respectively, on the value dat e and Reserve Bank will arrange to \nadvise the other participant Central Banks to make available the U.S. Dollar \nand Euro amounts to the commercial banks in their countries. \n \n6. Applicability of Foreign Exchange Regulations \n \nOperations conducted in and through the ACU Dollar and ACU Euro accounts will \nbe subject to compliance with all the FEMA regulations and the specific provisions \nof this Memorandum. \n \n 47.

Accordingly, banks\u2019 exposures to NBFC-IFCs will hencef orth be risk weighted as per \nthe ratings assigned to these NBFCs by t he rating agencies registered with the SEBI \nand accredited by the Reserve Bank of India.

CC No. 168 / 03.02.089 /2009-10                 February 12 , 2010 \nAll Non-Banking Financial Companies excluding Residuary N on-Bank \ning Companies \nDear Sir, \nInfrastructure Finance Companies\nPlease refer to paragraph 178  of the Second Quarter Re view of the Monetary \nPolicy for the year 2009-10. NBFC s-ND-SI engaged pr edominantly in \ninfrastructure financing have represented to the Reserve Bank that there should \nbe a separate category of infrastructure fi nancing NBFCs in view of the critical \nrole played by them in pr oviding credit to the infrastr ucture sector. Currently, the \nReserve Bank has classified NBFCs under three categories, viz., Asset Finance \nCompanies, Loan companies and Invest ment Companies. It has now been \ndecided to introduce a fourth category of NBFCs as \"Infrastructure Finance \nCompanies\"(IFCs). \n2. Accordingly, it is advised that the present classification of NBFCs stands\nmodified to include IFCs. An IFC is defined as non deposit taki\nng NBFC that\nfulfills the criteria mentioned below:\ni) a minimum of 75 per cent of its  total assets should be deployed in\ninfrastructure loans as defined in Para \n2(viii) of the Non B anking Financial (Non\nDeposit Accepting or Holding) Com panies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank)\nDirections, 2007;\nii) Net owned funds of Rs. 300 crore or above;\niii) minimum credit rating  'A'  or equivalent of CRISIL, FITCH, CARE, ICRA  or\nequivalent rating by any other accrediting rating agencies\niv) CRAR of 15 percent (with a minimu m Tier I capital of 10 percent). 2\n3.  IFCs may exceed the concentration of credit norms  as provided in paragraph \n18 of the aforesaid Directions as under: \n(i)  in lending to \n(a) any single borrower by ten per  cent of its owned fund; and \n(b) any single group of borrowers by fi fteen per cent of its owned  fund; \n(ii)  in lending and investing  (l oans/investments taken together)  by \n(a)  five percent of its ow ned fund to a single party; and \n(b) ten percent of its owned fund to a single group of parties.  \n(iii) The extant norms for investment fo r both sing le party and single group of \nparties will remain same as in Para 20 of the Directions referred to above. \n4. The present norms relating to infrastruc ture loan as laid out in Para 20 of  the \naforesaid Directions will continue for NBFCs that do not meet the criteria to be \nclassified as IFCs. \n5.  Since the classification for the purpose of income recognition, asset \nclassification and provisioning norms is based on asset specific ation, the ext\nant \nprudential norms will continue as hitherto.  \n6.  The companies satisfying the above conditions may approach the Regional \nOffice in the jurisdiction of which their Registered Office\n is located, along with the \noriginal Certificate of  Registration (CoR) issued by th e Bank for classification as \nInfrastructure Finance Companies. Their request must be supported by a \ncertificate from their Statutory Auditors  confirming the asset /income pattern of \nthe company as on March 31, of the latest financial year. The change in \nclassification would be incorporated in th e Certificate of Registration issued by \nthe Bank as NBFC-ND-IFC. \n7. The onus of including only eligible asse ts for the purpose of classification as \nIFC shall be that of the company concerned.  3\n8.

(DIR Series) Circular No. 5 dated \nAugust 1, 2005  relating to the External Commercial Borrowings (ECB). \n \n2.  As per the extant ECB proc edures, any changes in the terms and \nconditions of the ECB afte r obtaining the Loan Registra tion Number (LRN) from \nthe Department of Statistics and Informa tion Management (DSIM), Reserve Bank, \nrequire the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, the requests of the \nborrowers for changes in the terms and conditions, such as, drawdown / \nrepayment schedules, currency of borrowi ng and changes in designated AD bank, \nname of the borrowing company, etc. ar e referred to the Reserve Bank for \nnecessary approval.  \n \n3.  As a measure of simplification of the existing proc edures, it has been \ndecided to delegate powers to the desi gnated AD category-I banks to approve the \nfollowing requests from the ECB borrowers, subject to specified conditions:  \n \n \n  \n 2\n \n \na)  Changes / modifications in th e drawdown / repayment schedule  \n \nDesignated  AD Category \u2013 I  banks may approve changes / modifications in the \ndrawdown / repayment schedul e of the ECBs already availed, both under the \napproval  and the automatic routes, subject to the condition that the average \nmaturity period,  as declared while obtaining the LRN, is maintained . The \nchanges in the drawdown / repayment schedule should be promptly reported to \nthe DSIM, Reserve Bank in Form 83. Ho wever, any elongation / rollover in the \nrepayment on expiry of the original matu rity of the ECB would require the prior \napproval of the Reserve Bank. \n \nb)  Changes in the currency of borrowing \n \n Designated AD Category I banks may allo w changes in the currency of borrowing, \nif so desired, by the borrower company, in  respect of ECBs availed of both under \nthe automatic and the approval routes, subject to all other terms and conditions of \nthe ECB remaining unchanged.  Designated AD banks should, however, ensure \nthat the proposed currency of bor rowing is freely convertible. \n \nc)  Change of the AD bank \n \nDesignated AD Category - I banks may al low change of the existing designated \nAD bank by the borrower company for effect ing its transactions pertaining to the \nECBs subject to No-Objection Certificate (NOC) from the existing designated AD \nbank and after due diligence. \n \nd) Changes in the name of the Borrower Company \n \nDesignated AD Category - I banks ma y allow changes in the name of the \nborrower company subject to production of supporting document s evidencing the \nchange in the name from the Registrar of Companies.  \n \n4. The modifications to the ECB guidelines will come into force with \nimmediate effect.  All other aspects of t he ECB policy, such as USD 500 million  \n  \n 3\n \nlimit per company per financial year under the automatic r oute, eligible borrower, \nrecognised lender, end-use,   all-in-cost ceiling,   average  maturity  period, \nprepayment, refinancing of existing ECB and reporting arrangements remain \nunchanged. \n \n5.

As an initial \nstep towards prescribing capital requirem ent for market risks, Urban Cooperative \nBanks (UCBs) were advised to assign an additi onal risk weight of 2.5% on almost the \nentire investment portfolio.  These additional risk weights are clubbed wtih the risk \nweights prescribed for credit risk in respect of investment portfoli o of UCBs.  Further, \nUCBs were advised to assign a risk weight  of 100% on the open position limits on \nforeign exchange and gold and to build up Investment Fluctuation Reserve up to a \nminimum of 5% of the investments held in  Held for Trading and Available for Sale \ncategories in the investment portfolio.   \n \n2.  The interim measures adopted by UCBs  represent a broad brush and simplistic \napproach.  However, over a period of ti me, banks\u2019 ability to identify and measure \nmarket risk has improved.  The Advisory Panel on Financial Regulation and Supervision to the Committee on Financial Se ctor Assessment (Chairman: Dr Rakesh \nMohan and Co-Chairman: Shri  Ashok Chawla) which looked into the present \nregulatory and supervisory framework fo r UCBs, had recommended assigning duration \nbased capital charge for market risk fo r Scheduled UCBs that are systemically \nimportant and comparable in size to medium-sized commercial banks.    \n  \n \n \nAccordingly, it was proposed in the Annual Policy Statement  for the year 2009-10 to \nprescribe capital charge for market risk in respect of systemically  important and large \nsized UCBs with effect from Ap ril 1, 2010. In this backdrop,  it has been decided that \nUCBs having AD category I licence would provide capital for market risk with effect \nfrom April 1, 2010.  The gu idelines on capital charge for market risk are enclosed. \nUCBs are advised to restrict their exposure only to the permitted category of investments / instruments as per the extant  instructions and provide capital charge for \nmarket risk as per the guidelines. \n \n \nYours faithfully \n \n \n \n(A.K.

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and off  balance \nsheet positions arising out of  movements in market prices . The market risk positions \nsubject to capital charge requirement are as under: \n \n(i) The risks pertaining to interest rate  related instruments and equities in the \ntrading book; and \n \n(ii) Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) \nthroughout the bank (both banking and trading books). \n \n2.  The guidelines in this regard are organized under the following five sections: \n \n \nSection Particulars \nA Scope and coverage of capital charge for market risks \nB Measurement of capital charge for interest rate risk in the trading book \nC Measurement of capital charge fo r equities in the trading book \n(partially applicable for UCBs) \nD Measurement of capital charge for foreign exchange risk and gold \nopen positions \nE Aggregation of capital charge for market risks \n \n \nSection A \n \n3.    Scope and coverage of capital charge for market risks \n \n3.1   These guidelines seek to address th e issues involved in computing capital \ncharges for interest rate related instrum ents in the trading book, equities in the  \ntrading book and foreign exchange risk (includi ng gold and other precious  metals) in \nboth trading and banking books. Trading b ook for the purpose of capital adequacy \nwill include: \n \n (i) Securities included under the Held for Trading category \n(ii) Securities included under the Available for Sale category \n(iii) Open gold position limits \n(iv) Open foreign exchange position limits \n(v) Trading positions in derivatives, and     \n(vi) Derivatives entered into fo r hedging trading book exposures.  \n \n3.2   Banks are required to manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing \nbasis and ensure that the capital requirem ents for market risks are being maintained \non a continuous basis, i.e. at the clos e of each business day. Banks are also \nrequired to maintain strict risk management systems to monitor and control intra-day \nexposures to market risks. 2 \n  \n \n3.3   Capital for market risk would not be relevant for securities which have already \nmatured and remain unpaid. These securities will attract capital only for credit risk. \nOn completion of 90 days delinquency, thes e will be treated on par with NPAs for \ndeciding the appropriate risk weights for credit risk. \n \n \nSection B \n \n4   Measurement of capital ch arge for interest rate risk \n \n \n4.1  This section describes t he framework for measuring the ri sk of holding or  taking  \npositions in debt securities and other interest rate related instrument s in the trading book. \n \n    4.2   The capital charge for interest rate related instruments would apply to current \nmarket value of these items in bank's tradi ng book. Since banks are required to maintain \ncapital for market risks on an ongoing basis, they are requir ed to mark to market their \ntrading positions on a daily basis. The current  market value will be determined as per \nextant RBI guidelines on va luation of investments. \n \n    4.3   The minimum capi tal requirement is expressed in terms of two separately \ncalculated charges, (i) \"specific risk\" charge for each security, which is designed to \nprotect against an adverse movement in the pr ice of an individual security owing to \nfactors related to the individual issuer, both for short (short position is not allowed in India \nexcept in derivatives) and long positions, and (ii) \"general market risk\" charges towards \ninterest rate risk in the portfo lio, where long and short positions (which is not allowed in \nIndia except in derivatives and Central Government securities) in different securities or \ninstruments can be offset.  \n4.4   Capital Charge for Specific Risk  \nThe capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse movement \nin the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual issuer. The \nspecific risk charges for various kinds of  exposures would be as applied as detailed \nbelow:  \n \nNature of Investment \nSr. \nNo. Claims on Government  Maturity  Specific Risk Capital \nCharge (as % of exposure) \n1.

Investment in state government guaranteed securities \nincluded under items 2, 4 & 6 above where the investment is non-performing. However banks need to maintain capital at 9% only on those State Govt guaranteed securities \nissued by the defaulting entities and not on all the \nsecurities issued or guaranteed by that State Government.A\nll 9.00 \n  Claims on Banks      \nFor residual te\nfiorm to \nnal maturity 6 months \nr less 0.30 \nFor residual term to final maturity between 6 and 24 months 1.125 8.

They \nshould invest in securities that are permitted by the Reserve Bank from time to time. \nThe category 'claim on Government' will include all forms of Government securities including dated \nGovernment securities, Treasury bills and other short-term investments and instruments where \nrepayment of both principal and interest are fully guaranteed by the Government. The category \n'Claims on others' will include issuers of securi ties other than Government and banks.  Certain \ntypes of investments mentioned in the above table are not applicable for UCBs.  \n \n4.5  General Market Risk \n \nThe capital requirements for general market risk are designed to capture the risk of \nloss arising from changes in market interest  rates. The capital charge is the sum of \nfour components: \n \n(i) the net short  (which is  not allowed in India except  in derivatives) or long \nposition in the whole trading book; \n(ii) a small proportion of the matched positions  in each time-band (the        \n\u201cvertical disallowance\u201d); \n(iii)  a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time bands \n(the \u201chorizontal disallowance\u201d), and \n(iv) a net charge for positions in options, where appropriate. \n \n4.6    The Basle Committee has suggest ed two broad methodologi es for computation \nof capital charge for market risks. One is  the standardized method and the other is \nthe banks\u2019 internal risk management models method. As banks in India are still in a \nnascent stage of developing internal risk  management models, it  has been decided \nthat, to start with, banks may adopt the standardised method. Under the \nstandardised method there are two principal methods of measuring market risk, a \n\u201cmaturity\u201d method and a \u201c duration\u201d method.  \n \nA maturity / re-pricing schedule is used to evaluate the effects of changing interest \nrates on a bank\u2019s economic va lue by applying sensitivity weights to each time band.  \nTypically, such weights ar e based on estimates of the duration of assets and \nliabilities that fall into each time band.  Duration is measure of the percentage \nchange in the economic value of a position that will occur given a small change in \nthe level of interest rates.  It reflects the timing and size of cash flows that occur \nbefore the instrument\u2019s contractual maturity .  Generally, the longer the maturity or \nnext repricing date of the instruments and smaller the payments that occur before \nmaturity (eg coupon payments), the higher t he duration (in absolute value).  Higher \nduration implies that a given change in the level of interest rates will have a larger \nimpact on economic value. \n \nAs \u201cduration\u201d method is a more accurate me thod of measuring interest rate risk, it \nhas been decided to adopt standar dized duration method to arrive at the capital \ncharge. Accordingly, banks are required to measure the general market risk charge by calculating the price sensitivity (modifi ed duration) of each position separately. \nModified duration which is a st andard duration divided by 1 + r where r is the level of \nmarket interest rates \u2013 is an elasticity.  As  such it reflects the percentage change in 5 \n  \nthe economic value of the instrument for a given percentage change in 1 + r.  As with \nsimple duration, it assumes a linear relationship between percentage changes in \nvalue and percentage changes in interest ra tes.  Under this method, the mechanics \nare as follows: \n \n(i) first calculate the price sensitivit y (modified duration) of each instrument; \n(ii) next apply the assumed change in yield to the modified duration of each \ninstrument between 0. 6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the \nmaturity of the instrum ent (see Table-1 below); \n(iii) slot the resulting capital charge measures into a maturity ladder with the \nfifteen time bands as set out in Table-1; \n(iv) subject long and short positions (whi ch is not allowed in  India except in \nderivatives) in each time band to a 5 per cent vertical disallowance \ndesigned to capture basis risk; and \n(v) carry forward the net positions in each time-band for horizontal offsetting \nsubject to the disallowances set out in Table-2. \n \nTable 1 - Duration method \u2013 time bands and assumed changes in yield \n \nTime Bands Assumed \nChange in Yield Time Bands Assumed \nChange in Yield \nZone 1  Zone 3  \n1 month or less  1.00 3.6 to 4.3 yrs 0.75 \n1 to 3 months 1.00 4.3 to 5.7 yrs 0.70 \n3 to 6 months 1.00 5.7 to 7.3 yrs 0.65 \n6 to 12 months  1.00 7.3 to 9.3 yrs 0.60 \nZone 2  9.3 to 10.6 yrs 0.60 \n1.0 to 1.9 yrs 0.90 10.6 to 12 yrs 0.60 \n1.9 to 2.8 yrs 0.80 12 to 20 yrs 0.60 \n2.8 to 3.6 yrs 0.75 Over 20 yrs 0.60 \n \n \n \nTable 2  Horizontal Disallowances \n \nZones Time band Within the \nzones Between adjacent \nzones Between zones 1 and 3 \n1 month or less  \n1 to 3 months  \n3 to 6 months  Zone 1 \n \n6 to 12 months      \n \n     40% \n1.0 to 1.9 years \n1.9 to 2.8 years Zone 2 \n2.8 to 3.6 years     \n    30% \nZone 3 3.6 to 4.3 years \n4.3 to 5.7 years \n5.7 to 7.3 years \n7.3 to 9.3 years \n9.3 to 10.6 years \n10.6 to 12 years \n12 to 20 years  \nover 20 years     \n \n \n    30%  \n \n \n       40% \n \n \n \n \n \n     40%  \n \n \n \n \n \n     100% \n \n \n 6 \n  \n4.7  Capital charge for inte rest rate derivatives \n \nThe measurement of capital charge for mark et risks should include all interest rate \nderivatives and off-balance sheet instrument s in the trading book and derivatives \nentered into for hedging trading book exposures which would react to changes in the \ninterest rates, like FRAs, interest rate posit ions etc.  The details  of measurement of \ncapital charge for interest rate derivatives are furnished in Attachment I.  \n \nTwo examples for computing capital charge for market risks, including the vertical \nand horizontal disallowances are given in Attachment II & III. \n \n4.8    Capital charge for interest rate risk in foreign currencies \n \nDetails of computing capital charges for in terest rate risks in foreign currencies are \nas under: \n \n(i) Capital charges should be calculat ed for each currency separately and \nthen summed with no offsetting between positions of opposite sign. \n(ii) In the case of thos e currencies in which business is insignificant (where \nthe turnover in the respective curren cy is less than 5% of overall foreign \nexchange turnover), separate calcul ations for each currency are not \nrequired. The bank may, instead, slot within each appropriate time-band, \nthe net long or short posit ion for each currency. Howe ver, these individual \nnet positions are to be summed within each time-band, irrespective of \nwhether they are long or short pos itions, to produce a gross position \nfigure. The gross positions in eac h time-band will be subject to the \nassumed change in yield set out in Ta ble-1 above (Ref: para 4.6) with no \nfurther offsets. \n \nSection C \n \n5.  Measurement of capital charge for equity risk  \n \n5.1  The capital charge for equities woul d apply on their current market value in \nbank\u2019s trading book.  Minimum capital requ irement to cover the risk of holding or \ntaking positions in equities in the trading boo k is set out below. This is applied to all \ninstruments that exhibit market behavio ur similar to equities but not to non \nconvertible preference shares (which are covered by the interest rate risk requirements). The instruments covered in clude equity shares, whether voting or \nnon-voting, convertible securities that behav e like equities, for example: units of \nmutual funds, and commitments to buy or sell equity. \n \nSpecific and general market risk \n \n5.2  Capital charge for specific risk (akin to credit risk) will be 11.25% and specific \nrisk is computed on the banks\u2019 gross equity pos itions (i.e. the sum of all long equity \npositions and of all short equity positions \u2013 short equi ty position is, however, not \nallowed for banks in India. The general mark et risk charge will also be 9% on the \ngross equity positions. \n 7 \n  \n5.3  UCBs are, however not permitted to take exposure in equ ities, except in \ninvestments in the shares of  cooperatives, subject to cert ain limits and therefore, not \nexposed to equity risk. \n \nSection D \n \n6   Measurement of capital charge for foreign exchange and gold open \npositions \n \nForeign exchange open positions and gold open positions are at present risk-\nweighted at 100%. Thus, capital charge for market risks in foreign exchange and gold open position is 9%. These open positions, limits or actual whichever is \nhigher, would continue to attract capital charge at 9%. This capital charge is in \naddition to the capital charge for credi t risk on the on-balance sheet and off-balance \nsheet items pertaining to forei gn exchange and gold transactions. \n \nSection E \n \n7  Aggregation of the capital charge for market risks \n \nAs explained earlier capital charges for sp ecific risk and general market risk are to \nbe computed separately before aggregation. For computing th e total capital charge \nfor market risks, the calculations ma y be plotted in the following table: \n \nProforma 1 \n                                                                                                        (Rs. in crore) \nRisk Category Capital charge \n \nI.

Interest rate derivatives  \n \nThe measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and offbalance- \nsheet instruments in the trading book, which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. \nforward rate agreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate \nand cross-currency swaps and forward forei gn exchange positions). Options can be \ntreated in a variety of ways as described in  B.1 below. A summary  of the rules for \ndealing with interest rate derivatives is set ou t in the Table at the end of this section. \n \n1. Calculation of positions \n \nThe derivatives should be converted into pos itions in the releva nt underlying and be \nsubjected to specific and general market risk  charges as described in the guidelines. \nIn order to calculate the capital charge, the amounts r eported should be the market \nvalue of the principal amount  of the underlying or of the notional underlying. For \ninstruments where the apparent not ional amount differs from the effective notional \namount, banks must use the effective notional amount.  \n \n(a) Futures and forward contracts, including forward rate agreements \n \nThese instruments are treated as a combi nation of a long and a short position in a \nnotional government security. The maturity of a future or a FRA will be the period \nuntil delivery or exercise of the contract, plus - where applicable - the life of the underlying instrument. For example, a long position in a June three-month interest \nrate future (taken in April) is to be r eported as a long posit ion in a government \nsecurity with a maturity of five months and a short position in a government security \nwith a maturity of two months. Where a range of deliverab le instruments may be \ndelivered to fulfill the contra ct, the bank has flexibility to elect which deliverable \nsecurity goes into the duration ladder but  should take account of any conversion \nfactor defined by the exchange. \n \n(b) Swaps \n \nSwaps will be treated as tw o notional positions in go vernment securities with \nrelevant maturities. For example, an interest rate swap under which a bank is \nreceiving floating rate interest and paying fixed will be treated as a long position in a \nfloating rate instrument of maturity equiva lent to the period until the next interest \nfixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the \nresidual life of the swap. For swaps that pay or receive a fixed or floating interest rate \nagainst some other reference pr ice, e.g. a stock index, t he interest rate component \nshould be slotted into the appropriate repricing maturity category, with the equity component being included in the equity framework.  Separat e legs of cross-currency \nswaps are to be reported in  the relevant maturity ladders for the currencies \nconcerned. 13 \n  \n2. Calculation of capital charges for derivatives under the standardized \nmethodology \n \n(a) Allowable offsetting of matched positions \n \nBanks may exclude the followi ng from the interest rate ma turity framework altogether \n(for both specific and general market risk); \n \n\u2022 Long and short positions (both actual and notional) in identical instruments \nwith exactly the same issuer, coupon, currency and maturity. \n\u2022 A matched position in a future or fo rward and its corres ponding underlying may \nalso be fully offset, (the leg representing th e time to expiry of the future should \nhowever be reported) and thus excluded from the calculation. \n \nWhen the future or the forward comprise s a range of deliver able instruments, \noffsetting of positions in the future or  forward contract and its underlying is only \npermissible in cases where there is a readily  identifiable underlying security which is \nmost profitable for the trader with a short position to deliver. The price of this \nsecurity, sometimes called the \"cheapest-to-de liver\", and the price of the future or \nforward contract should in such  cases move in close alignment. \n \nNo offsetting will be allowed between positions  in different currencies; the separate \nlegs of cross-currency swaps or forward fo reign exchange deals ar e to be treated as \nnotional positions in the relevant instruments and included in the appropriate \ncalculation for each currency. \n \nIn addition, opposite positions in the same category of instruments can in certain \ncircumstances be regarded as matched and allowe d to offset fully. To qualify for this \ntreatment the positions must relate to the same underlying inst ruments, be of the \nsame nominal value and be denominated in  the same currency. In addition: \n \n\u2022 for futures: offsetting positions in the notional or underlying instruments to which \nthe futures contract relates must be fo r identical products and mature within \nseven days of each other; \n\u2022 for swaps and FRAs: the reference rate (for floating rate positions) must be \nidentical and the coupon closely matched (i.e. within 15 basis points); and \n\u2022  for swaps, FRAs and forw ards: the next interest fixi ng date or, for fixed coupon \npositions or forwards, the residual matu rity must correspond within the following \nlimits: \no less than one month hence: same day; \no between one month and one year hence: within seven days; \no over one year hence: within thirty days. \n \nBanks with large swap books may use al ternative formulae for these swaps to \ncalculate the positions to be included in the dur ation ladder. The me thod would be to \ncalculate the sensitivity of the net present value implied by the change in yield used \nin the duration method and al locate these sensitivities in to the time-bands set out in \nTable 2 in Section B. \n \n 14 \n  \n(b) Specific risk \n \nInterest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, forward foreign exchange contracts and \ninterest rate futures will not be subject to a specific risk charge. This exemption also \napplies to futures on an interest rate index (e.g. LIBOR). However, in the case of \nfutures contracts where the underlying is a debt security, or an index representing a \nbasket of debt securities, a specific risk c harge will apply according to the credit risk \nof the issuer as set out in paragraphs above. \n \n(c) General market risk \n \nGeneral market risk applies to positions in all derivative products in the same \nmanner as for cash positions, subject only to  an exemption for fully or very closely \nmatched positions in identical instrument s as defined in paragraphs above. The \nvarious categories of instruments should be slotted into the maturity ladder and \ntreated according to the rules identified earlier. \n \nTable - Summary of treatment of interest rate derivatives \n \nInstrument Specific risk \ncharge \n General Market risk \nCharge \nExchange-traded future \n- Government debt security \n- Corporate debt security \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR)   \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions  \nOTC forward \n- Government debt security \n- Corporate debt security \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR)  \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions \nFRAs, Swaps No Yes, as two positions \nForward Foreign Exchange No Yes, as one position in \neach currency \nOptions \n- Government debt security \n- Corporate debt security \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR) \n- FRAs, Swaps  \nNo \nYes \nNo \nNo  \n \nB. Treatment of Options \n \n1. In recognition of the wide di versity of banks\u2019 activities in  options and the difficulties \nof measuring price risk for options, alte rnative approaches are permissible as under: \n \n\u2022 those banks which solely use purchased options*  will be free to use the \nsimplified approach described in Section I below; \n\u2022 those banks which also write options will be ex pected to use one of the \nintermediate approaches as set out in Section II below. \n 15 \n  \n2. In the simplified approach , the positions for the options and the associated \nunderlying, cash or forward, are not subj ect to the standardised methodology but \nrather are \"carved-out\" and subject to separately calculated capital charges that \nincorporate both general market risk and  specific risk. The risk numbers thus \ngenerated are then added to the c apital charges for the relevant category, i.e. \ninterest rate related instruments, equi ties, and foreign exchange as described in \nSections B to D. The delta-plus method uses the sensitivity parameters or \"Greek \nletters\" associated with options to me asure their market risk and capital \nrequirements. Under this method, the delta -equivalent position of each option \nbecomes part of the standardised methodology set out in Section B to D with the delta-equivalent amount subject to t he applicable general market risk charges. \nSeparate capital charges are then applied to  the gamma and vega risks of the option \npositions. The scenario approach uses simulation techniques to calculate changes \nin the value of an options portfolio for c hanges in the level and volatility of its \nassociated underlyings. Under this approach, the general market risk charge is determined by the scenario \"grid\" (i.e. th e specified combinat ion of underlying and \nvolatility changes) that produces the larges t loss. For the delta-plus method and the \nscenario approach the specif ic risk capital charges ar e determined separately by \nmultiplying the delta-equivalent  of each option by the specif ic risk weights set out in \nSection B and Section C. \n \n* Unless all their written option positions are hedged by perfectly matched long positions in exactly \nthe same options, in which case no capital charge for market risk is required \n \nI. Simplified approach \n \n3. Banks which handle a limit ed range of purchased options only will be free to use \nthe simplified approach set out in  Table A below, for partic ular trades. As an example \nof how the calculation would work, if a holder of 100 shares currently valued at Rs.10 \neach holds an equivalent put option with a strike price of Rs.11, the capital charge \nwould be: Rs.1,000 x 18% (i.e. 9% specific plus 9% gene ral market risk) = Rs.180, \nless the amount the option is in the money (Rs.11 \u2013 Rs.10) x 100 = Rs.100, i.e. the capital charge would be Rs.80. A simila r methodology applies for options whose \nunderlying is a foreign currency or an interest rate related instrument. \n \nTable A                                    Simplified approach: capital charges \n \nPosition Treatment \n \nLong cash and Long put \nOr \nShort cash and Long call \n The capital charge will be t he market value of the \nunderlying security1 multiplied by the sum of specific \nand general market risk charges2 for the underlying \nless the amount the option is in the money (if any) bounded at zero\n3\n \nLong call \nOr \nLong put \n The capital charge will be the lesser of: \n(i) the market value of the underlying security multiplied by the sum of specific and general market risk charges\n3 for the underlying \n(ii) the market value of the option4\n 16 \n  \n1.    In some cases such as foreign exchange, it may be unclear which side is the \"underlying security\"; \nthis should be taken to be the asset which would be received if the option were exercised. In addition \nthe nominal value should be used for items where t he market value of the un derlying instrument could \nbe zero, e.g. caps and floors, swaptions etc. \n \n2.   Some options (e.g. where the underlying is an in terest rate or a currency) bear no specific risk, but \nspecific risk will be present in the case of options on certain interest rate-related instruments (e.g. \noptions on a corporate debt security  or corporate bond index; see Se ction B for the relevant capital \ncharges) and for options on equities and stock indices (see Section C). The charge under this measure for currency options will be 9%. \n \n3.  For options with a residual maturity of more than six months, the strike  price should be compared \nwith the forward, not current, price. A bank unable to do this must take the \"in-the-money\" amount to be zero. \n \n4.   Where the position does not fall within the tr ading book (i.e. options on certain foreign exchange or \ncommodities positions not belonging to the trading bo ok), it may be acceptable to use the book value \ninstead. \n \nII. Intermediate approaches \n \n(a) Delta-plus method \n \n4. Banks which write opti ons will be allowed to include delta-weighted options \npositions within the standardised methodology set out in Section B - D. Such options \nshould be reported as a po sition equal to the market  value of the underlying \nmultiplied by the delta. \n \nHowever, since delta does not sufficiently cover the risks associated with options \npositions, banks will also be  required to measure gamma (which measures the rate \nof change of delta) and vega (which measures  the sensitivity of  the value of an \noption with respect to a change in  volatility) sensitivities in order to calculate the total \ncapital charge. These sensitivities will be calculated according to an approved \nexchange model or to the bank \u2019s proprietary options pricing model subject to \noversight by the Reserve Bank of India1. \n \n5.  Delta-weight ed positions with debt securities or interest rates as the underlying \nwill be slotted into the interest rate time- bands, as set out in Table 2 of Section B, \nunder the following procedure.  A two-legged approach should be used as for other \nderivatives, requiring one entry  at the time the underlying contract takes effect and a \nsecond at the time the underlying contra ct matures. For instance, a bought call \noption on a June three-month in terest-rate future will in Ap ril be considered, on the \nbasis of its delta-equivalent value, to be a long position with a maturity of five months \nand a short position with a maturity of two months2. The written option will be \nsimilarly slotted as a long position with a ma turity of two months and a short position \nwith a maturity of five months. Floating ra te instruments with caps or floors will be \ntreated as a combination of floating rate se curities and a series of European-style \noptions. For example, the holder of a three- year floating rate bond indexed to six \nmonth LIBOR with a cap of  15% will treat it as: \n \n(i) a debt security that re prices in six months; and \n \n(ii) a series of five written call options on a FRA with a reference rate \nof15%, each with a negative sign at the time the underlying FRA 17 \n  \ntakes effect and a positive sign at the time the underlying FRA \nmatures3. \n \n1.  Reserve Bank of India may wish to require ba nks doing business in ce rtain classes of exotic \noptions (e.g. barriers, digitals) or in options \"at-the-money\" that are close to expiry to use either the \nscenario approach or the internal models alte rnative, both of which can accommodate more \ndetailed revaluation approaches. \n \n2. A two-months call option on a bond future, where delivery of the bond takes place in September, \nwould be considered in April as being long the bond and short a five-months deposit, both positions \nbeing delta-weighted. \n \n3.   The rules applying to closely-matched positions set out in paragraph 2 (a) of this Annex will also apply in this respect. \n \n6. The capital charge for options with equities as the underlying will also be based on \nthe delta-weighted positions wh ich will be incorporated in t he measure of market risk \ndescribed in Section C. For purposes of this  calculation each national market is to be \ntreated as a separate underlyi ng. The capital charge for options on foreign exchange \nand gold positions will be based on the method set out in Section D. For delta risk, \nthe net delta-based equivalent  of the foreign curren cy and gold options will be \nincorporated into the measur ement of the exposure for the respective currency (or \ngold) position. \n \n7.  In addition to the above capital charges arising from delta risk, there will be \nfurther capital charges for gamma and for vega risk. Banks using the delta-plus \nmethod will be required to calculate t he gamma and vega for each option position \n(including hedge positions) separately. The c apital charges should be calculated in \nthe following way: \n \n(i) for each individual option a \"gamma impact\" should be calculated \naccording to a Taylor series expansion as: \n \nGamma impact = \u00bd x Gamma x VU\u00b2 \nwhere VU = Variation of t he underlying of the option. \n \n(ii) VU will be calculated as follows: \n \n\u2022 for interest rate options if the underlying is a bond, the price \nsensitivity should be worked out as explained. An equivalent \ncalculation should be carried out  where the underlying is an \ninterest rate. \n \n\u2022 for options on equities and equity indices; which are not \npermitted at present, the market value of the under lying should \nbe multiplied by 9%1; \n \n\u2022 for foreign exchange and gold opti ons: the market value of the \nunderlying should be multiplied by 9%; \n \n(iii) For the purpose of this calculat ion the following positions should be \ntreated as the same underlyin g: 18 \n  \n\u2022 for interest rates2 each time-band as set out in Table 2 of the \nguidelines;3 \n\u2022 for equities and stock indi ces, each national market; \n\u2022 for foreign currencies and gold,  each currency pair and gold; \n \n(iv) Each option on the same underlyin g will have a gamma impact that is \neither positive or negative. These individual gamma impacts will be summed, \nresulting in a net gamma impact for each underlying that is either positive or \nnegative. Only those net gamma impacts that are negative will be included in \nthe capital calculation. \n \n(v) The total gamma capital charge will be  the sum of the absolute value of \nthe net negative gamma impacts as calculated above. \n \n(vi) For volatility risk, banks will be required to calc ulate the capital charges \nby multiplying the sum of the vegas fo r all options on the same underlying, as \ndefined above, by a proportional  shift in volatility of \u00b1 \uf02025%. \n \n(vii) The total capital charge for vega risk will be the sum of the absolute \nvalue of the individual capital charges that have been calculated for vega risk. \n \n1. The basic rules set out here for interest rate and equity options do not attempt to capture \nspecific risk when calculating gamma capital charges. However, Reserve Bank may require \nspecific banks to do so. \n \n2 .  Positions have to be slotted into sepa rate maturity ladders by currency. \n \n3. Banks using the duration method should use the time-bands as set out in Table 3 of the \nguidelines. \n \n(b) Scenario approach \n \n8.  More sophisticated banks will also hav e the right to base the market risk capital \ncharge for options portfolios an d associated hedging positions on scenario matrix \nanalysi s. This will be accomplished by specif ying a fixed range of changes in the \noption portfolio\u2019s risk factors and calculat ing changes in the value of the option \nportfolio at various points along this \"grid\". For the purpose of calculating the capital \ncharge, the bank will reval ue the option portfolio using matrices for simultaneous \nchanges in the option\u2019s underlyi ng rate or price and in the volatility of that rate or \nprice. A different matrix will be set up for each individual underlying as defined in \nparagraph 7 above. As an alternat ive, at the discretion of  each national authority, \nbanks which are significant traders in opti ons for interest rate options will be \npermitted to base the calculation on a mini mum of six sets of time bands. When \nusing this method, not more than three of  the time-bands as defined in Section B \nshould be combined into any one set. \n \n9. The options and related hedging positions will be evaluated over a specified range \nabove and below the current value of the underlying. The r ange for interest rates is \nconsistent with the assumed changes in yiel d in Table 12 of Section B. Those banks \nusing the alternative method for interest rate options set out in paragraph 8 above \nshould use, for each set of time-bands, the highest of the assumed changes in yield 19 \n  \napplicable to the group to which the time-bands belong1. The other ranges are \u00b19 % \nfor equities and \u00b19 % for fore ign exchange and gold. For all risk categories, at least \nseven observations (including the current ob servation) should be  used to divide the \nrange into equally spaced intervals. \n \n1 If, for example, the time-bands 3 to 4 years, 4 to 5 years and 5 to 7 years are combined, the highest \nassumed change in  yield of these three bands would be 0.75.  \n \n10.  The second dimension of the matrix entails a change in the volatility of the \nunderlying rate or price. A si ngle change in the volatility of the underlying rate or \nprice equal to a shift in volatility of + 25%  and - 25% is expected to be sufficient in \nmost cases. As circumstances warrant, however, the Reserve Bank may choose to \nrequire that a different change in volatility  be used and / or that intermediate points \non the grid be calculated. \n \n11.  After calculating the matr ix, each cell contains the net profit or loss of the option \nand the underlying hedge instrument. The capital charge for each underlying will \nthen be calculated as the largest loss contained in the matrix. \n \n12.   In drawing up these intermediate ap proaches it has been sought to cover the \nmajor risks associated with optio ns. In doing so, it is conscious  that so far as specific \nrisk is concerned, only the delta-related elem ents are captured; to capture other risks \nwould necessitate a much more complex r egime. On the other hand, in other areas \nthe simplifying assumptions used have resulted in a relatively conservative treatment \nof certain options positions. \n \n13.  Besides the options ri sks mentioned above, the RBI is  conscious of the other \nrisks also associated with options , e.g. rho (rate of change of the value of the option \nwith respect to the interest rate) and theta (rate of change of the value of the option \nwith respect to time). While not proposi ng a measurement system for those risks at \npresent, it expects banks undertaking significant  options business at the very least to \nmonitor such risks closely. Additionally, banks will be permitted to incorporate rho \ninto their capital calculations for inte rest rate risk, if they wish to do so. \n \n******** \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 \n  \nAttachment-II  \nWorked out examples for computing capital charge for market risks  \nExample indicating computati on of capital charge for mark et risks \u2013 without equities \nand interest rate related derivative instruments is given below: \n          A bank ma y have the following position: \nSl.

Disallowances \nThe price sensitivities calculated as abov e have been slotted into a duration-based \nladder with fifteen time-bands ( Attachment III ). Long and short positions within a time \nband have been subjected to vertical disallowanc e of 5%. In the instant case, vertical \ndisallowance is applicable under 3-6 mont h time band and 7.3-9.3 year time band. \nThen, net positions in eac h time band have been computed for horizontal offsetting \nsubject to the disallowances mentioned in t he table. In the instant case, horizontal \ndisallowance is applicable only in respect of Zone 3. Horizontal disallowances in \nrespect of adjacent zones are not applicable in the instant case. \n3.1.  Calculation of Vertical Disallowance  \nWhile calculating capital charge for general market risk on interest rate related \ninstruments, banks should  recognize the bas is risk (different types of instruments \nwhose price responds differently for move ment in general rates) and gap risk \n(different maturities within timebands). Th is is addressed by a small capital charge \n(5%) on matched (off-setting) positions in each time band (\"Vertical Disallowance\") \nAn off-setting position, for vertical disallowance, will be the either the sum of long \npositions and or the short pos itions within a time band, whichever is lower. In the \nabove example, except for the time band 3- 6 months in Zone 1 and the time band of \n7.3-9.3 years, where there ar e off-setting positions of (-) 0.45 and 2.79, there is no \noff-setting position in any other time band. The sum of long positions in the 3-6 \nmonths time band is + 0.47 and the sum of short positions in this time band is (-) 0.45. This off-setting positi on of 0.45 is subjected to a capital charge of 5% i.e. \n0.0225. The sum of long positio ns in the 7.3-9.3 years time band is + 2.79 and the \nsum of short positions in this time band is ( -) 3.08. This off-setti ng position of 2.79 is \nsubjected to a capital charge of 5% i.e. 0.1395. It may be mentione d here that if a \nbank does not have both long and short positions in the same time band, there is no \nneed for any vertical disallowance. Banks in India are not allowed to take any short position in their books, except  in derivatives. Therefore, banks in India will generally \nnot be subject to vertical disallowanc e unless they have a short position in \nderivatives. \n3.2    Calculation of Hori zontal Disallowance  \nWhile calculating capital charge for general market risk on interest rate related instruments, banks must subject their posit ions to a second round of off-setting \nacross time bands with a view to give re cognition to the fact that interest rate \nmovements are not perfectly correlated across maturity bands (yield curve risk and spread risk) i.e matched long and short positions in different time bands may not \nperfectly off-set. This is achiev ed by a \"Horizontal Disallowance\". \nAn off-setting position, for horizontal disall owance, will be the either the sum of long \npositions and or the short pos itions within a Zone, whichev er is lower. In the above \nexample, except in Zone 3 (7.3 to 9.3 years) where there is an off-setting (matched) \nposition of (-) 0.29 , there is no off-setting position in any other Zone.

In July 2009, the Basel Committee on B anking Supervision (BCBS) had finalised \nenhancements and revisions in certain areas of the Basel II framework. The enhanced/ \nrevised guidance of BCBS is cont ained in their three documents, viz., Enhancements to \nthe Basel II Framework; Revisions to the Basel II Market Risk Framework; and \nGuidelines for Computing Capital Charge for Incremental Risk in the Trading Book. \nThese enhancements and revisions are in tended to strengthen the framework and \nrespond to lessons learnt from the financial crisis. \n154. The enhancements and revisions now sti pulated by BCBS are, however, mostly \napplicable to advanced approaches  of the Basel II framewor k. Banks in India have \nimplemented standardised/basic approaches cont ained in the framework. However, \nwherever those enhancements and revisions  are applicable to standardised/basic \napproaches, it is proposed: \n\u2022  to issue detailed guidelines  as appropriate for implem entation by banks operating \nin India by end-November 2009. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n TABLE OF CONTENTS \nPart \u2013 A : Minimum Capital Requirement (Pillar 1) \n1 Introduction 9\n2 Approach to Implementation, Effective Date & Parallel Run 9\n3 Scope of Application 12\n4 Capital Funds 12\n 4.1 General 12\n 4.2 Elements of Tier I Capital 14\n 4.3 Elements of Tier II capital 16\n 4.4 Deductions from Capital 18\n5 Capital Charge for Credit Risk 20\n 5.1 General 20\n 5.2 Claims on Domestic Sovereigns 21\n 5.3 Claims on Foreign Sovereigns 21\n 5.4 Claims on Public Sector Entities 22\n 5.5 Claims on MDBs, BIS and IMF 22\n 5.6 Claims on Banks 23\n 5.7 Claims on Primary Dealers 25\n 5.8 Claims on Corporates 25\n 5.9 Claims included in the Regulatory Retail Portfolios 27\n 5.10 Claims secured by Residential Property 29\n 5.11 Claims secured by Commercial Real Estate 30\n 5.12 Non-Performing Assets 30\n 5.13 Specified Categories 31\n 5.14 Other Assets 32\n 5.15 Off-Balance Sheet Items 33\n  5.15.1 General 33\n  5.15.2 Non-Market-related Off-balance Sheet items 33\n  5.15.3 Market-related Off-balance Sheet items 36\n  5.15.4 Current Exposure Method 37\n  5.15.5 Failed Transactions 38\n 5.16 Securitisation Exposures 40\n  5.16.1 General  405 \n   5.16.2 Deduction of Securitisation Exposures from Capital \nFunds 42\n  5.16.3 Implicit Support 42\n  5.16.4 Application of External Ratings 43\n  5.16.5 Risk-weighted Securitisation Exposures 44\n  5.16.6 Off-balance Sheet Securitisation Exposures 45\n  5.16.7 Recognition of Credit Risk Mitigants 45\n  5.16.8 Liquidity Facilities 46\n  5.16.9 Re-Securitisation Exposures 46\n6 External Credit Assessments 47\n 6.1 Eligible Credit Rating Agencies 47\n 6.2 Scope of Application of External Ratings 48\n 6.3 Mapping Process 49\n 6.4 Long Term Ratings 50\n 6.5 Short Term Ratings 51\n 6.6 Use of Unsolicited Ratings 51\n 6.7 Use of Multiple Rating Assessments 52\n 6.8 Applicability of Issue rating to Issuer/other claims 52\n7 Credit Risk Mitigation 53\n 7.1 General Principles 53\n 7.2 Legal certainty 54\n 7.3 Credit Risk Mitigation techniques \u2013 Collateralised  Transactions 54\n  7.3.2 Overall framework and minimum conditions 55\n  7.3.4 The Comprehensive Approach 56\n  7.3.5 Eligible Financial Collateral 57\n  7.3.6 Calculation of Capital Requirement 58\n  7.3.7 Haircuts 59\n  7.3.8 Capital Adequacy Framework for Repo-/Reverse Repo-style Transactions. 62\n 7.4 Credit Risk Mitigation techniques \u2013 On\u2013balance Sheet netting 63\n 7.5 Credit Risk Mitigation techniques \u2013 Guarantees 64\n  7.5.4 Operational requirements for Guarantees 64\n  7.5.5 Additional operational requirements for Guarantees 65\n  7.5.6 Range of Eligible Guarantors (counter-guarantors) 656 \n   7.5.7 Risk Weights 66\n  7.5.8 Proportional Cover 66\n  7.5.9 Currency Mismatches 66\n  7.5.10 Sovereign guarantees and counter-guarantees 66\n 7.6 Maturity Mismatch 67\n  7.6.2 Definition of Maturity 67\n  7.6.3 Risk weights for Maturity Mismatches 67\n 7.7 Treatment of pools of CRM Techniques 68\n8 Capital Charge for Market Risk 68\n 8.1 Introduction 68\n 8.2 Scope and Coverage of Capital Charge for Market Risks 68\n 8.3 Measurement of Capital Charge for Interest Rate Risk 69\n 8.4 Measurement of Capital Charge for Equity Risk 83\n 8.5 Measurement of Capital Charge for Foreign Exchange Risk 84\n 8.6 Aggregation of the Capital Charge for Market Risk 85\n 8.7 Treatment of illiquid positions 85\n9 Capital charge for Operational Risk 92\n 9.1 Definition of Operational Risk 92\n 9.2 The Measurement Methodologies 93\n 9.3 The Basic Indicator Approach 93\nPart \u2013 B :  Supervisory Review  and Evaluation Process (Pillar 2) \n10 Introduction to Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) 95\n11 Need for improved risk management 97\n12 Guidelines for SREP of the RBI and the ICAAP of the Bank 98\n 12.1 The Background 98\n 12.2 Conduct of the SREP by the RBI 101\n 12.3 The Structural Aspects of the ICAAP  102\n 12.4 Review of ICAAP outcomes 108\n 12.5 ICAAP to be an integral part of the mgmt. & decision making culture 109\n 12.6 The principle of proportionality 109\n 12.7 Regular independent review and validation 111\n 12.8 ICAAP to be a forward looking process 111\n 12.9 ICAAP to be a risk based process 1127 \n  12.10 ICAAP to include stress tests and scenario analysis 112\n 12.11 Use of capital models for ICAAP 113\n13  Select operational aspects of ICAAP 113\nPart \u2013 C : Market Discipline (Pillar 3) \n14.

Introduction      \n1.1 With a view to adopting the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) framework \non capital adequacy which takes into account the elements of credit risk in various types of assets in the balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet business and also to strengthen the \ncapital base of banks, Reserve Bank of India de cided in April 1992 to introduce a risk asset ratio \nsystem for banks (including foreign banks) in India as a capital adequacy measure.  Essentially, \nunder the above system the balance sheet asse ts, non-funded items and other off-balance sheet \nexposures are assigned prescribed risk weights and banks have to maintain unimpaired minimum capital funds equivalent to the prescribed ratio on the aggregate of the risk weighted \nassets and other exposures on an ongoing basis. Reserve Bank has issued guidelines to banks \nin June 2004 on maintenance of capital charge for market risks on the lines of \u2018Amendment to the Capital Accord to incorporate market risks\u2019 issued by the BCBS in 1996. \n1.2 The BCBS released the \"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital \nStandards: A Revised Framework\" on June 26, 2004.  The Revised Framework was updated in \nNovember 2005 to include trading activities and the treatment of double default effects and a \ncomprehensive version of the framework was issued in June 2006 incorporating the constituents of capital and the 1996 amendment to the Capital Accord to incorporate Market Risk. The \nRevised Framework seeks to arrive at signific antly more risk-sensitive approaches to capital \nrequirements. The Revised Framework provides a range of options for determining the capital \nrequirements for credit risk and operational risk to allow banks and supervisors to select approaches that are most appropriate for their operations and financial markets.  \n2. Approach to implementation, Effective date and Parallel run  \n2.1 The Revised Framework consists of three-mutually reinforcing Pillars, viz. minimum \ncapital requirements, supervisory review of capital adequacy, and market discipline. Under Pillar 1, the Framework offers three distinct options for computing capital requirement for credit risk \nand three other options for computing capital requirement for operational risk. These options for \ncredit and operational risks are based on increasing risk sensitivity and allow banks to select an approach that is most appropriate to the stage of development of bank's operations. The options available for computing capital for credit risk are Standardised Approach, Foundation Internal 10 \n                                            Rating Based Approach and Advanced Internal Rating Based Approach. The options available \nfor computing capital for operational risk are Basic Indicator Approach, Standardised Approach and Advanced Measurement Approach.  \n2.2 Keeping in view Reserve Bank\u2019s goal to have consistency and harmony with international standards, it has been decided that all commercial banks in India (excluding Local Area Banks and Regional Rural Banks) shall adopt Standardised Approach (SA) for credit risk and Basic \nIndicator Approach (BIA) for operational risk. Banks shall continue to apply the Standardised \nDuration Approach (SDA) for computing capital requirement for market risks.  \n2.3 Effective Date:  Foreign banks operating in India and Indian banks having operational \npresence outside India migrated  to the above selected approaches under the Revised \nFramework with effect from March 31, 2008. All other commercial banks (except Local Area \nBanks and Regional Rural Banks)  migrated  to these approaches under the Revised Framework \nby March 31, 2009. \n2.4 Parallel Run:  With a view to ensuring smooth transition to the Revised Framework and \nwith a view to providing opportunity to banks to streamline their systems and strategies, banks \nwere advised to have a parallel run of the re vised Framework. The Boards of the banks should \nreview the results of the parallel run on a quarterly basis.  The  features of the   parallel run are \nas under: \n     i) Banks should apply the prudential guidelines on capital adequacy \u2013 both guidelines viz. Basel I and these guidelines on the Revised Framework \u2013 on an on-going basis and compute their Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) under both the guidelines.   \n      ii)  An analysis of the bank's CRAR under both the guidelines should be reported to the Board at quarterly intervals. For this purpose,  banks may adopt the reporting format furnished vide Annex - 1 .\n1\n      iii) A copy of the quarterly reports, for the quarters ending on June, September and December, duly approved by the Boards in the format prescribed, may  be sent to the Chief \nGeneral Manager-in-Charge, Department of Banki ng Supervision, Central Office, Reserve Bank \nof India, World Trade Centre, Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Mumbai \u2013 400  005, so as to reach not later \n \n1 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.92/21.06.001/2008-09 dated December 4, 2008 11 \n than a month from the end of the quarter to which it relates. In respect of the quarter ending  \nMarch,  the report may be sent within two months from the end of  the quarter.  In cases, where the Board\u2019s approval of the report is likely to take longer time, banks  may furnish an advance \ncopy of  the report to the RBI, to be followed by  the comments /remarks/guidance of the Board, if \nany, on the report. \n \n2.5 Migration to other approaches under the Revised Framework:   Having regard to \nthe necessary up-gradation of  risk management framework as also capital efficiency \nlikely to accrue to the banks by adoption of the advanced approaches envisaged under \nthe Basel II Framework and the emerging international trend in this regard, it is \nconsidered desirable to lay down a timeframe for implementation of the advanced \napproaches in India. This wo uld enable the banks to plan and prepare for their migration \nto the advanced approaches for credit risk and operat ional risk, as also for the Internal \nModels Approach (IMA) for market risk. \n2.5.1 Keeping in view the likely lead time that may be needed by the banks for creating \nthe requisite technological and the risk management infrastructure, including the \nrequired databases, the MIS and the skill up-gradation, etc., the following time schedule \nhas been laid down for implementation of the advanced approaches for the regulatory \ncapital measurement : \nS. \nNo. Approach The earliest date of \nmaking application \nby banks to the RBI Likely date of \napproval by the RBI \na. Internal Models Approach (IMA) for \nMarket Risk April 1, 2010 March 31, 2011 \nb. The Standardised Approach (TSA) for Operational Risk April 1, 2010 September 30, 2010 \nc. Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) for Operational Risk April 1, 2012 March 31, 2014 \nd. Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approaches for Credit Risk \n(Foundation- as well as Advanced \nIRB) April 1, 2012 March 31, 2014 \n \n2.5.2 The banks should undertake an internal  assessment of their preparedness for \nmigration to advanced approaches, in the light of the criteria envisaged in the Basel II \ndocument, as per the aforesaid time schedule, and take a decis ion, with the approval of 12 \n their Boards, whether they would like to mi grate to any of the advanced approaches. The \nbanks deciding to migrate to the advanced approaches may approach us for necessary \napprovals, in due course, as per the stipulated time schedule. If the result of a bank's \ninternal assessment indicates th at it is not in a position to  apply for implementation of \nadvanced approach by the above ment ioned dates, it may choose a later date suitable to \nit based upon its preparation. \n \n2.5.3 It may be noted that the banks, at their discretion, would have the option of \nadopting the advanced approaches for one or more  of the risk categories, as per their \npreparedness, while continuing with the simpler approaches for other risk categories, \nand it would not be necessary to adopt the advanced approaches for all the risk \ncategories simultaneously. However, the banks should invariably  obtain prior approval of \nthe RBI for adopting any of  the advanced approaches.  \n3. Scope of Application\nThe revised capital adequacy norms shall be app licable uniformly to all Commercial Banks \n(except Local Area Banks and Regional Rural Banks), both at the solo level (global position) as \nwell as at the consolidated level. A Consolidated bank is defined as a group of entities where a \nlicensed bank is the controlling entity. A consolidated bank will include all group entities under its \ncontrol, except the exempted entities. In terms of guidelines on preparation of consolidated \nprudential reports issued vide circular DBOD. No.BP.BC.72/ 21.04.018/ 2001-02 dated February 25, 2003; a consolidated bank may exclude group companies which are engaged in insurance business and businesses not pertaining to financial services. A consolidated bank should maintain a minimum Capital to Risk-weighted A ssets Ratio (CRAR) as applicable to a bank on \nan ongoing basis. \n \n4. Capital funds\n4.1 General \n4.1.1 Banks are required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) \nof 9 percent on an ongoing basis. The Reserve Bank will take into account the relevant risk factors and the internal capital adequacy assessments of each bank to ensure that the capital \nheld by a bank is commensurate with the bank\u2019s overall risk profile. This would include, among \nothers, the effectiveness of the bank\u2019s risk management systems in identifying, assessing / 13 \n measuring, monitoring and managing various risks including interest rate risk in the banking \nbook, liquidity risk, concentration risk and residual risk. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank will consider prescribing a higher level of minimum capital ratio for each bank under the Pillar 2 \nframework on the basis of their respective risk profiles and their risk management systems. \nFurther, in terms of the Pillar 2 requirements of the New Capital Adequacy Framework, banks are expected to operate at a level well above the minimum requirement.  \n4.1.2 The minimum capital maintained by banks on implementation of the Revised Framework \nshall be subjected to a prudential floor2, which shall be the higher of the following amounts:  \na)  Minimum capital required to be maintained as per the Revised Framework; \nb) A specified per cent of the minimum capital required to be maintained as per the \nBasel I framework for credit and market risks. The specified per cent will \nprogressively decline as indicated in Table 1.  \n                  \n Table 1 \u2013 Prudential floor \n \nFinancial year ending* March \n2008 March \n2009 March \n2010 \nPrudential Floor (as % of minimum capital  \nrequirement computed as per current (Basel I) \nframework for credit and market risks) 100 90 80 \n* The relevant periods shall be March 2009, 2010, and 2011 for banks \nimplementing the Revised Framework with effect from March 31, 2009 \n \nThe adequacy and the need for the capital floors will be reviewed periodically on the basis of the \nquality and integrity of Basel II implementation in banks. In case the supervisory assessments indicate satisfactory level and quality of compli ance by banks, the capital floor may be dispensed \nwith even before the above period. \n4.1.3 Banks are encouraged to maintain, at both solo and consolidated level, a Tier I CRAR of \nat least 6 per cent. Banks which are below this level must achieve this ratio on or before March \n31, 2010.  \n4.1.4 A bank should compute its Tier I CRAR and Total CRAR in the following manner:  \n                                            \n2 The need for continuing with the prudential floor will be reviewed periodically by the Reserve Bank.  14 \n Tier I CRAR =                                    Eligible Tier I capital funds3                              .     \nCredit Risk RWA* + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA \n* RWA = Risk weighted Assets \nTotal CRAR =                                    Eligible total capital funds4                          .         \nCredit Risk RWA + Market Risk RWA + Operational Risk RWA \n \n \n4.1.5 Capital funds are broadly classified as Tier I and Tier II capital. Elements of Tier II capital \nwill be reckoned as capital funds up to a maximum of 100 per cent of Tier I capital, after making \nthe deductions/ adjustments referred to in paragraph 4.4. \n \n4.2 Elements of Tier I capital \n4.2.1 For Indian banks, Tier I capital would include the following elements: \ni) Paid-up equity capital, statutory reserves, and other disclosed free reserves, if any; \n \nii) Capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets; \n \niii) Innovative perpetual debt instruments eligible for inclusion in Tier I capital, which \ncomply with the regulatory requirements as specified in Annex -  2;  \n \niv) Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS), which comply with the \nregulatory requirements as specified in Annex \u2013 3;    and \n \nv) Any other type of instrument generally notified by the Reserve Bank from time to time \nfor inclusion in Tier I capital. \n \n4.2.2 Foreign currency translation reserve arising consequent upon application of Accounting \nStandard 11 (revised 2003): \u2018The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates\u2019; shall not be an eligible item of capital funds. \n4.2.3 For foreign banks in India, Tier I capital would include the following elements: \n(i) Interest-free funds from Head Office kept in a separate account in Indian books \nspecifically for the purpose of meeting the capital adequacy norms. \n \n(ii) Statutory reserves kept in Indian books. \n \n(iii) Remittable surplus retained in Indian books which is not repatriable so long as the \n                                            \n3 Total Tier I capital funds, subject to prudential limits for Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments minus deductions \nfrom Tier I capital \n \n4 Total of eligible Tier I capital funds and eligible Tier II capital funds, subject to prudentia l limits for Innovative Tier I \ninstruments, Upper Tier II instrum ents and subordinated debt instruments minus deductions from Tier I and Tier II \ncapital  15 \n bank functions in India. \n \n(iv) Capital reserve representing surplus arising out of sale of assets in India held in a \nseparate account and which is not eligible for repatriation so long as the bank \nfunctions in India. \n(v) Interest-free funds remitted from abroad for the purpose of acquisition of property \nand held in a separate account in Indian books. \n(vi) Head Office borrowings in foreign currency  by foreign banks operating in India for \ninclusion in Tier I capital which comply with the regulatory requirements as \nspecified in Annex 2 and \n(vii) Any other item specifically allowed by the Reserve Bank from time to time for \ninclusion in Tier I capital. \n4.2.4 Notes: \n(i) Foreign banks are required to furnish to Reserve Bank, an undertaking to the \neffect that the bank will not remit abroad the  'capital reserve' and \u2018remittable \nsurplus retained in India\u2019 as long as they function in India to be eligible for including this item under Tier I capital. \n(ii) These funds may be retained in a separate account titled as 'Amount Retained in \nIndia for Meeting Capital to Risk-weighted Asset Ratio (CRAR) Requirements' under 'Capital Funds'. \n(iii) An auditor's certificate to the effect that these funds represent surplus remittable \nto Head Office once tax assessments are completed or tax appeals are decided \nand do not include funds in the nature of provisions towards tax or for any other \ncontingency may also be furnished to Reserve Bank.  \n(iv) The net credit balance, if any, in the inter-office account with Head Office / \noverseas branches will not be reckoned as capital funds. However, any debit \nbalance in the Head Office account will have to be set-off against capital.  \n(v) Banks may include quarterly/half yearly profits for computation of Tier I capital \nonly if the quarterly/half yearly results are audited by statutory auditors and not \nwhen the results are subjected to limited review.  \n \n4.2.5 Limits on eligible Tier I capital  \n(i)  The Innovative perpetual debt instruments (IPDIs), eligible to be reckoned as Tier \nI capital, will be limited to 15 percent of total Tier I capital as on March 31 of the previous \nfinancial year. The above limit will be based on t he amount of Tier I capital as on March 31 \nof the previous financial year, after deduction of goodwill, DTA and other intangible assets \nbut before the deduction of investments, as required in paragraph 4.4.  16 \n (ii) The outstanding amount of Tier I preference shares i.e Perpetual Non-Cumulative \nPreference Shares along with Innovative Tier I instruments shall not exceed 40 per cent of total Tier I capital at any point of time. The above limit will be based on the amount of Tier I \ncapital after deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets but before the deduction of \ninvestments as per para 4.4.6 below. Tier I preference shares issued in excess of the overall ceiling of 40 per cent, shall be eligible for inclusion under Upper Tier II capital, subject to limits prescribed for Tier II capital. However, investors' rights and obligations would remain unchanged.\n \n(iii) Innovative instruments / PNCPS, in excess of the limit shall be eligible for \ninclusion under Tier II, subject to limits prescribed for Tier II capital. \n \n4.3 Elements of Tier II capital \n4.3.1 Revaluation reserves    \nThese reserves often serve as a cushion against unexpected losses, but they are less \npermanent in nature and cannot be considered as \u2018Core Capital\u2019. Revaluation reserves arise \nfrom revaluation of assets that are undervalued on the bank\u2019s books, typically bank premises. \nThe extent to which the revaluation reserves can be relied upon as a cushion for unexpected losses depends mainly upon the level of certainty that can be placed on estimates of the market \nvalues of the relevant assets, the subsequent deterioration in values under difficult market \nconditions or in a forced sale, potential for actual liquidation at those values, tax consequences \nof revaluation, etc. Therefore, it would be prudent to consider revaluation reserves at a discount \nof 55 percent while determining their value for inclusion in Tier II capital. Such reserves will have to be reflected on the face of the Balance Sheet as revaluation reserves. \n \n4.3.2   General Provisions and Loss Reserves . \nSuch reserves, if they are not attributable to the actual diminution in value or identifiable potential \nloss in any specific asset and are available to m eet unexpected losses, can be included in Tier II \ncapital. Adequate care must be taken to see that sufficient provisions have been made to meet \nall known losses and foreseeable potential losses before considering general provisions and loss \nreserves to be part of Tier II capital. Banks are allowed to include the General Provisions on 17 \n Standard Assets, Floating Provisions5, Provisions held for Country Exposures, Investment \nReserve Account and excess provisions which arise on account of sale of NPAs6 in Tier II \ncapital. However, these five  items will be admitted as Tier II capital up to a maximum of 1.25 per \ncent of the total risk-weighted assets. \n4.3.3  Hybrid debt capital instruments\nIn this category, fall a number of debt capital in struments, which combine certain characteristics \nof equity and certain characteristics of debt. Each has a particular feature, which q1can be \nconsidered to affect its quality as capital. Where these instruments have close similarities to equity, in particular when they are able to support losses on an ongoing basis without triggering liquidation, they may be included in Tier II capital. Banks in India are allowed to recognise funds \nraised through debt capital instrument which has a combination of characteristics of both equity \nand debt, as Upper Tier II capital provided the instrument complies with the regulatory \nrequirements specified in \nAnnex 4 .  Indian Banks are also allowed to issue Perpetual \nCumulative Preference Shares (PCPS), Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares \n(RNCPS) and Redeemable Cumulative Preference S hares (RCPS), as Upper Tier II Capital, \nsubject to extant legal provisions as per guidelines contained in Annex 5.  \n4.3.4 Subordinated debt  \nTo be eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital, the instrument   should be fully paid-up, unsecured, subordinated to the claims of other  creditors, free of restrictive clauses, and should not be redeemable at the initiative of the holder or without the consent of the Reserve Bank of India. \nThey often carry a fixed maturity, and as they approach maturity, they should be subjected to \nprogressive discount, for inclusion in Tier II capital. Instruments with an initial maturity of less \nthan 5 years or with a remaining maturity of one year should not be included as part of Tier II capital. Subordinated debt instruments eligible to be reckoned as Tier II capital shall comply with \nthe regulatory requirements specified in Annex \n6.  \n4.3.5   Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) and Perpetual Non-Cumulative    \nPreference Shares (PNCPS)\n \n                                            \n5 Banks will continue to have the option to net off such provisions from Gr oss NPAs to arrive at Net NPA or \nreckoning it as part of their Tier II capital as per circular DBOD. NO. BP.BC 33/21.04.048/2009-10 dated \nAugust 27, 2009. \n6 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC .118/21.04.048/2008-09 dated March 25, 2009. 18 \n IPDI in excess of 15 per cent of Tier I capital {cf. Annex 2, Para 1(ii)} may be included in Tier II, \nand PNCPS in excess of the overall ceiling of 40  per cent ceiling prescribed vide paragraph 4.2.5 \n{cf. Annex 3. Para 1.1} may be included under Upper Tier II capital, subject to the limits \nprescribed for Tier II capital. \n4.3.6  Any other type of instrument generally notified by the Reserve Bank from time to time for \ninclusion in Tier II capital. \n4.3.7 Limits on Tier II Capital  \nUpper Tier II instruments along with other components of Tier II capital shall not exceed 100 per cent of Tier I capital. The above limit will be based on the amount of Tier I after deduction of goodwill, DTA and other intangible assets but before deduction of investments. \n4.3.8 Subordinated debt instruments eligible for inclusion in Lower Tier II capital will be limited to 50 percent of Tier I capital after all deductions. \n \n4.4 Deductions from capital  \n4.4.1 Intangible assets and losses in the current period and those brought forward from previous periods should be deducted from Tier I capital.  \n4.4.2 The DTA computed as under should be deducted from Tier I capital:  \ni) DTA associated with accumulated losses; and  \nii) The DTA (excluding DTA associated with accumulated losses), net of DTL. \nWhere the DTL is in excess of the DTA (excluding DTA associated with \naccumulated losses), the excess shall neither be adjusted against item (i) nor \nadded to Tier I capital.  \n4.4.3 Any gain-on-sale  arising at the time of securitisation of standard assets, as defined in \nparagraph 5.16.1 , if recognised , should be deducted entirely from Tier I capital. In terms of \nguidelines on securitisation of standard assets, ban ks are allowed to amortise the profit over the \nperiod of the securities issued by the SPV. The am ount of profits thus recognised in the profit \nand loss account through the amortisation process need not be deducted.  \n4.4.4 Banks should not recognise minority interests that arise from consolidation of less than \nwholly owned banks, securities or other financial entities in consolidated capital to the extent \nspecified below:  \ni) The extent of minority interest in the capital of a less than wholly owned \nsubsidiary which is in excess of the regulatory minimum for that entity. \n \nii) In case the concerned subsidiary does not have a regulatory capital 19 \n requirement, the deemed minimum capital requirement for that entity may be \ntaken as 9 per cent of the risk weighted assets of that entity. \n \n4.4.5 Securitisation exposures, as specified in paragraph 5.16.2 , shall be deducted from \nregulatory capital and the deduction must be made 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from \nTier II, except where expressly provided otherwise . Deductions from capital may be calculated \nnet of any specific provisions maintained against the relevant securitisation exposures.  \n \n4.4.6 In the case of investment in financial subsidiaries and associates, the treatment will be as under for the purpose of capital adequacy:  \n(i) The entire investments in the paid up equity of the financial entities (including \ninsurance entities), which are not consolidated for capital purposes with the bank, \nwhere such investment exceeds 30% of the paid up equity of such financial entities \nand entire investments in other instruments eligible for regulatory capital status in \nthose entities shall be deducted, at 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from \nTier II capital.  (For investments less than 30 per cent, please para 5.13.7) \n \n \n(ii) Banks should ensure that majority owned financial entities that are not \nconsolidated for capital purposes and for which the investment in equity and other instruments eligible for regulatory capital status is deducted, meet their respective regulatory capital requirements.  In  case  of  any  shortfall    in   the     \nregulatory capital requirements in the de-consolidated entity, the shortfall shall be fully deducted at 50 per cent from Tier I capital and 50 per cent from Tier II capital.  \n \n4.4.7 An indicative list of institutions which may be deemed to be financial institutions for capital \nadequacy purposes is as under: \no Banks, \no Mutual funds, \no Insurance companies, \no Non-banking financial companies, \no Housing finance companies, \no Merchant banking companies, \no Primary dealers.  \n \n4.4.8  A bank's aggregate investment in all types of instruments, eligible for capital status of investee  banks / FIs / NBFCs / PDs as listed in paragraph 4.4.9 below,  excluding those \ndeducted in terms of paragraph 4.4.6, should not exceed 10 per cent of the investing bank's \ncapital funds (Tier I plus Tier II, after adjustments) . Any investment in excess of this limit shall be \ndeducted at 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from Tier II capital.  Investments in equity or \ninstruments eligible for capital status issued by  FIs / NBFCs / Primary Dealers  which are, within \nthe aforesaid ceiling of 10 per cent and thus, are not deducted from capital funds, will attract a \nrisk weight of 100 per cent or the risk weight as applicable to the ratings assigned to the relevant 20 \n instruments, whichever is higher. As regards th e treatment of investments in equity and other \ncapital-eligible instruments of scheduled banks , within the aforesaid ceiling of 10 per cent,   will \nbe risk weighted as per paragraph 5.6.1. Further, in the case of non-scheduled banks, where \nCRAR has become negative, the investments in the capital-eligible instruments even within the \naforesaid 10 per cent limit shall be fully deducted at 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from \nTier II capital, as per paragraph 5.6.1. \n4.4.9  Banks' investment in the following instruments will be included in the prudential limit of \n10 per cent referred to at paragraph 4.4.8 above. \na) Equity shares; \nb) Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares  \nc) Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments \nd) Upper Tier II Bonds \ne) Upper Tier II Preference Shares (PCPS/RNCPS/RCPS)  \nf) Subordinated debt instruments;  and  \ng) Any other instrument approved by the RBI as in the nature of capital. \n \n4.4.10  The investments made by a banking subsidia ry/associate in the equity or non equity \nregulatory-capital instruments issued by its parent bank, should be deducted from such \nsubsidiary's regulatory capital at 50 per cent each from Tier I and Tier II capital, in its capital \nadequacy assessment on a solo basis. The regulatory treatment of investment by the non-banking financial subsidiaries / associates in the parent bank's regulatory capital would, \nhowever, be governed by the applicable regulatory capi tal norms of the respective regulators of \nsuch subsidiaries / associates. \n4.4.11 It has come to our notice that certain investors such as Employee Pension Funds have \nsubscribed to regulatory capital issues of commercial banks concerned. These funds enjoy the counter guarantee by the bank concerned in respect of returns. When returns of the investors of \nthe capital issues are counter guaranteed by the bank, such investments will not be considered \nas Tier I/II regulatory capital for the purpose of capital adequacy.  \n \n5. Capital Charge for Credit Risk \n5.1       General  \nUnder the Standardised Approach, the rating assigned by the eligible external credit rating \nagencies will largely support the measure of credit risk. The Reserve Bank has  identified the \nexternal credit rating agencies that meet the eligibility criteria specified under the revised 21 \n Framework. Banks may rely upon the ratings assigned by the external credit rating agencies \nchosen by the Reserve Bank for assigning risk weights for capital adequacy purposes as per the mapping furnished in these guidelines.  \n5.2      Claims on Domestic Sovereigns \n5.2.1 Both fund based and non fund based claims on the central government will attract a zero risk weight. Central Government guaranteed claims will attract a zero risk weight. \n5.2.2 The Direct loan / credit / overdraft exposure, if any, of banks to the State Governments and the investment in State Government securities will attract zero risk weight. State \nGovernment guaranteed claims will attract 20 per cent risk weight\u2019. \n5.2.3 The risk weight applicable to claims on central government exposures will also apply to \nthe claims on the Reserve Bank of India, DICGC and Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Small Industries (CGTSI). The claims on ECGC will attract a risk weight of 20 per cent. \n5.2.4 The above risk weights for both direct claims and guarantee claims will be applicable as long as they are classified as \u2018standard\u2019/ performing assets. Where these sovereign exposures are classified as non-performing, they would attract risk weights as applicable to NPAs, which \nare detailed in Paragraph \n5.12.  \n5.2.5    The amount outstanding in the account styled as \u2018Amount receivable from Government of \nIndia under Agricultural Debt Waiver Scheme, 2008\u2019  shall be treated as a claim on the \nGovernment of India and would attract zero risk weight for the purpose of capital adequacy \nnorms. However, the amount outstanding in the accounts covered by the Debt Relief Scheme \nshall be treated as a claim on the borrower and risk weighted as per the extant norms.7\n5.3     Claims on Foreign Sovereigns  \n5.3.1 Claims on foreign sovereigns will attract risk weights as per the rating assigned8 to \nthose sovereigns / sovereign claims by international rating agencies as follows: \n                                            \n7 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.26/21.04.048/20 08-09 dated July 30, 2008  \n8 For example: The risk weight assigned to an investment in US Treasury Bills by SBI branch in Paris, irrespective of \nthe currency of funding, will be determined by the rating as signed to the Treasury Bills, as indicated in Table 2. 22 \n Table 2: Claims on foreign sovereigns \u2013 Risk weights  \nS & P*/ FITCH   \nratings AAA to AA A BBB BB to B Below B Unrated \nMoody\u2019s ratings Aaa to Aa A Baa Ba to  B Below B Unrated \nRisk weight 0 % 20  % 50 % 100 % 150 % 100 % \n* Standard & Poor\u2019s \n5.3.2 Claims denominated in domestic currency of the foreign sovereign met out of the \nresources in the same currency raised in the jurisdiction9 of that sovereign will, however, attract \na risk weight of zero percent. \n \n5.3.3  However, in case a Host Supervisor requires a more conservative treatment to such \nclaims in the books of the foreign branches of the Indian banks, they should adopt the \nrequirements prescribed by the Host Country supervisors for computing capital adequacy. \n \n5.4       Claims on public sector entities (PSEs) \n \n5.4.1 Claims on domestic public sector entities will be risk weighted in a manner similar to \nclaims on Corporates.  \n \n5.4.2 Claims on foreign PSEs will be risk weighted as per the rating assigned by the international rating agencies as under: \n \nTable 3: Claims on foreign PSEs \u2013 Risk weights \nS&P/ Fitch \nRatings AAA \nTo AA  \nA BBB to BB Below BB Unrated \nMoody\u2019s \nratings Aaa to Aa  \nA  \nBaa to Ba \n Below Ba Unrated \nRW (%) 20 50  100  150  100  \n \n5.5      Claims on MDBs, BIS and IMF  \nClaims on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nand the following eligible Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) evaluated by the BCBS will be \n                                            \n9 For example: The risk weight assigned to an investment in US Treasury Bills by SBI branch in New York will attract a \nzero per cent risk weight, irrespective of the rating of t he claim, if the investment is  funded from out of the USD \ndenominated resources of SBI, New York. In case the SB I, New York, did not have any USD denominated resources, \nthe risk weight will be determined by the rating assigned to  the Treasury Bills, as indicated in Table 2 above. 23 \n treated similar to claims on scheduled banks meeting the minimum capital adequacy \nrequirements and assigned a uniform twenty percent risk weight : \n \na) World Bank Group: IBRD and IFC,  \nb) Asian Development Bank,  \nc) African Development Bank,  \nd) European Bank for Reconstruction & Development,  \ne) Inter-American Development Bank,  \nf) European Investment Bank, \ng) European Investment Fund,  \nh) Nordic Investment Bank,  \ni) Caribbean Development Bank,  \nj) Islamic Development Bank and  \nk) Council of Europe Development Bank.  \nSimilarly, claims on the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm) will also attract a \ntwenty per cent risk weight.   \n5.6 Claims on banks  \n5.6.1 The claims on banks incorporated in India and the branches of foreign banks in India, other \nthan those deducted in terms of paragraph 4.4.6., 4.4.8 and 4.4.10 above, , will be risk weighted \nas under \nTable 4: Claims on banks incorporated in India and foreign bank branches in India \n \nRisk Weights \nAll Scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial,    Regional \nRural Banks, Local Area \nBanks and Co-Operative \nBanks ) All Non-Scheduled Banks  \n(Commercial,    Regional Rural \nBanks, Local Area Banks and \nCo-Operative Banks )  \n \nLevel of  \nCRAR (in%) of \nthe investee \nbank \n(where  \navailable)  Investments \nwithin 10 % \nlimit referred to \nin paragraph \n4.4.8 above  \n \n(in per cent) All other \nclaims  \n(in per \ncent) Investments \nwithin 10  per \ncent limit referred \nto in paragraph \n4.4.8 above \n \n(in per cent) All Other \nClaims \n \n(in per cent)\n1 2 3 4 5 24 \n 9  and above Higher of 100 % \nor the risk weight \nas per the rating of the instrument \nor counterparty, \nwhichever is higher  \n20  Higher of 100 % or \nthe risk weight as \nper the rating of the instrument or \ncounterparty, \nwhichever is higher  \n100  \n6  to < 9  150  50  250  150  \n3  to < 6  250  100 350  250  \n0 to < 3  350  150  625  350  \nNegative 625  625   Full deduction * 625  \n* The deduction should be made @ 50% each, from Tier I and Tier II capital. \n \nNotes:  \ni) In the case of banks where no capital adequacy norms have been prescribed by the \nRBI, the lending / investing bank may calculate the CRAR of the cooperative bank \nconcerned, notionally, by obtaining necessa ry information from the investee bank, \nusing the capital adequacy norms as applicable to the commercial banks. In case, it \nis not found feasible to compute CRAR on such notional basis, the risk weight of \n350 or 625 per cent, as per the risk perception of the investing bank, should be applied uniformly to the investing bank\u2019s entire exposure.   \n \nii) In case of banks where capital adequacy norms are not applicable at present, the \nmatter of investments in their capital-eligible instruments would not arise for now.  \nHowever, column No. 2 and 4 of the Table above will become applicable to them, if \nin future they issue any capital instruments where other banks are eligible to invest.     \n \n5.6.2       The claims on foreign banks will be risk weighted as under as per the ratings assigned \nby international rating agencies.  \nTable 5: Claims on foreign banks \u2013 Risk weights \nS &P / FITCH \nratings AAA to AA A BBB BB to B Below B Unrated \nMoody\u2019s \nratings Aaa to Aa A Baa Ba to B Below B Unrated \nRisk weight 20 % 50 % 50 % 100 % 150 % 50 % \n \nThe exposures of the Indian branches of foreign banks, guaranteed / counter-guaranteed by the \noverseas Head Offices or the bank\u2019s branch in another country would amount to a claim on the \nparent foreign bank and would also attract the risk weights as per Table 5 above.  \n \n5.6.3     However, the claims on a bank which are denominated in 'domestic10' foreign currency \n                                            \n10 For example: A Euro denominated claim of SBI branch in Pa ris on BNP Paribas, Paris which is funded from out of 25 \n met out of the resources in the same currency raised in that jurisdiction will be risk weighted at \n20 per cent provided the bank complies with the minimum CRAR prescribed by the concerned bank regulator(s).  \n \n5.6.4    However, in case a Host Supervisor requires a more conservative treatment for such claims in the books of the foreign branches of the Indian banks, they should adopt the \nrequirements prescribed by the Host supervisor for computing capital adequacy. \n5.7        Claims on Primary Dealers  \nClaims on Primary Dealers shall be risk weighted in a manner similar to claims on corporates. \n5.8       Claims on corporates \n5.8.1 Claims on corporates11, including the exposures on Asset Finance Companies (AFCs) , \nshall be risk weighted as per the ratings assigned by the rating agencies registered with the \nSEBI and accredited by the Reserve Bank of India.

Claims included in this portfolio shall be assigned a risk-\nweight of 75 per cent, except as provided in paragraph 5.12 below for non performing assets.  \n5.9.2   The following claims, both fund based and non fund based, shall be excluded from the \nregulatory retail portfolio:  \n(a) Exposures by way of investments in securities (such as bonds and equities), \nwhether listed or not;  \n(b) Mortgage loans to the extent that they qualify for treatment as claims secured by \nresidential property14 or claims secured by commercial real estate15;  \n(c) Loans and advances to bank\u2019s own staff which are fully covered by superannuation \nbenefits and / or mortgage of flat/ house; \n(d) Consumer credit, including personal loans and credit card receivables; \n(e) Capital market exposures; \n(f)  Venture capital funds. \n5.9.3      Qualifying criteria\n(i) Orientation criterion  - The exposure (both fund-based and non fund-based) is to an \nindividual person or persons or to a small bus iness; Person under this clause would mean \nany legal person capable of entering into contracts and would include but not be restricted to \nindividual, HUF, partnership firm, trust, private limited companies, public limited companies, co-operative societies etc. Small business is one where the total average annual turnover is \n                                            \n14  Mortgage loans qualifying for treatment as \u2018claim s secured by residential property\u2019 are defined in  paragraph 5.10 \nbelow. \n15 As defined in paragraph 5.11.1 below.  28 \n less than Rs. 50 crore. The turnover criterion will be linked to the average of the last three \nyears in the case of existing entities; project ed turnover in the case of new entities; and both \nactual and projected turnover for entities which are yet to complete three years. \n(ii) Product criterion  - The exposure (both fund-based and non fund-based) takes the \nform of any of the following: revolving credits and lines of credit (including overdrafts), term \nloans and leases (e.g. instalment loans and leases, student and educational loans) and small \nbusiness facilities and commitments.   \n \n(iii) Granularity criterion  - Banks must ensure that the regulatory retail portfolio is \nsufficiently diversified to a degree that reduces the risks in the portfolio, warranting the 75 per \ncent risk weight. One way of achieving this is that no aggregate exposure to one counterpart \nshould exceed 0.2 per cent of the overall regulatory retail portfolio. \u2018 Aggregate exposure \u2019 \nmeans gross amount (i.e. not taking any benefit for credit risk mitigation into account) of all \nforms of debt exposures (e.g. loans or commitments) that individually satisfy the three other \ncriteria. In addition, \u2018 one counterpart\u2019 means one or several entities that may be considered \nas a single beneficiary (e.g. in the case of a small business that is affiliated to another small business, the limit would apply to the bank's aggregated exposure on both businesses). While banks may appropriately use the group exposure concept for computing aggregate exposures, they should evolve adequate system s to ensure strict adherence with this \ncriterion. NPAs under retail loans are to be excluded from the overall regulatory retail portfolio when assessing the granularity criterion for risk-weighting purposes. \n \n \n(iv) Low value of individual exposures  - The maximum aggregated retail exposure to one \ncounterpart should not exceed the absolute threshold limit of Rs. 5 crore.  \n \n5.9.4   For the purpose of ascertaining compliance with the absolute threshold, exposure would \nmean sanctioned limit or the actual outstanding, whichever is higher, for all fund based and non-fund based facilities, including all forms of off-balance sheet exposures. In the case of term loans \nand EMI based facilities, where there is no scope for redrawing any portion of the sanctioned \namounts, exposure shall mean the actual outstanding.  \n5.9.5   The RBI would evaluate at periodic intervals the risk weight assigned to the retail portfolio \nwith reference to the default experience for these exposures. As part of the supervisory review process, the RBI would also consider whether the credit quality of regulatory retail claims held by 29 \n individual banks should warrant a standard risk weight higher than 75 per cent. \n5.10       Claims secured by residential property \n \n5.10.1  Lending to individuals meant for acquiring residential property which are fully secured by \nmortgages on the residential property that is or will be occupied by the borrower, or that is rented, shall be risk weighted as indicated below, provided the loan to value ratio (LTV) is not \nmore than 75 per cent, based on Board approved  valuation  policy. LTV ratio should be \ncomputed as a percentage with total outstanding in the account (viz. \u201cprincipal + accrued interest \n+ other charges pertaining to the loan\u201d without any netting) in the numerator and the realisable value of the residential property mortgaged to the bank in the denominator. \n \n \nAmount of loan Risk weight \nUp to Rs.30  lakh 50 % \nRs.  30  lakh and above 75 % \n \n5.10.2    Lending for acquiring residential property, which meets the above criteria but have LTV \nratio of more than 75 per cent, will attract a risk weight of 100 per cent.

In the case of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), the risk weight \nwill be 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be according to the ratings assigned to these entities\n21.    \n5.14.4   All other assets will attract a uniform risk weight of 100 per cent.       \n \n \n5.15   Off-balance sheet items \n5.15.1       General  \ni) The total risk weighted off-balance sheet credit exposure is calculated as the sum of the \nrisk-weighted amount of the market related and non-market related off-balance sheet \nitems. The risk-weighted amount of an off-balance sheet item that gives rise to credit \nexposure is generally calculated by  means of a two-step process: \n \n(a) the notional amount of the transaction is converted into a credit equivalent \namount, by multiplying the amount by the specified credit conversion factor \nor by applying the current exposure method, and \n \n(b) the resulting credit equivalent amount is multiplied by the risk weight \napplicable to the counterparty or to the purpose for which the bank has \nextended finance or the type of asset, whichever is higher.  \nii) Where the off-balance sheet item is secured by eligible collateral or guarantee, the credit \nrisk mitigation guidelines detailed in paragraph 7 may be applied. \n5.15.2     Non-market-related off balance sheet items  \ni) The credit equivalent amount in relation to a non-market related off-balance sheet item \nlike, direct credit substitutes, trade and performance related contingent items and \ncommitments with certain drawdown, other commitments, etc. will be determined by \nmultiplying the contracted amount of that par ticular transaction by the relevant credit \nconversion factor (CCF). \nii) Where the non-market related off-balance sheet item is an undrawn or partially undrawn \nfund-based facility22, the amount of undrawn commitment to be included in calculating the \n                                            \n21 Please refer to circular DBOD.No.BP.BC134/21.06.001/2008-09 dated May 26, 2009 \n22  For example: (a) In the case of a cash credit facility for Rs.100 lakh (which is not unconditionally cancellable) where \nthe drawn portion is Rs. 60 lakh, the undr awn portion of Rs. 40 lakh will attract a CCF of 20 per cent (since the CC 34 \n off-balance sheet non-market related credit exposures is the maximum unused portion of \nthe commitment that could be drawn during the remaining period to maturity. Any drawn portion of a commitment forms a part of bank's on-balance sheet credit exposure.  \niii) In the case of irrevocable commitments to provide off-balance sheet facilities, the original \nmaturity will be measured from the commencem ent of the commitment until the time the \nassociated facility expires. For example an irrevocable commitment with an original \nmaturity of 12 months, to issue a 6 month documentary letter of credit, is deemed to have \nan original maturity of 18 months. Irrevocable commitments to provide off-balance sheet \nfacilities should be assigned the lower of the two applicable credit conversion factors. For \nexample, an irrevocable commitment with an orig inal maturity of 15 months (50 per cent - \nCCF) to issue a six month documentary letter of credit (20 per cent - CCF) would attract the lower of the CCF i.e., the CCF applicable to the documentary letter of credit viz. 20 \nper cent.  \niv) The credit conversion factors for non-market related off-balance sheet transactions are as \nunder: \nTable 8: Credit conversion factors \u2013 Non-market related off-balance sheet items \n \nSr. \nNo. Instruments Credit \nConversion \nFactor (%) \n1.

The credit equivalent amount of Rs. 8 lakh (20 % of Rs.40 \nlakh) will be assigned the appropriate risk weight as applicable  to the counterparty / rating to  arrive at the risk weighted \nasset for the undrawn portion. The drawn portion (Rs. 60 lakh) will attract a risk weight as applicable to the \ncounterparty / rating.  \n \n(b) A TL of Rs. 700 cr is sanctioned for a large project whic h can be drawn down in stages over a three year period. \nThe terms of sanction allow draw down in three stages \u2013 Rs . 150 cr in Stage I, Rs. 200 cr in Stage II and Rs. 350 cr in \nStage III, where the borrower needs the bank\u2019s explicit approva l for draw down under Stages II and III after completion \nof certain formalities. If the borrower has drawn already Rs. 50 cr under Stage I, then the undrawn portion would be \ncomputed with reference to Stage I alone i.e., it will be Rs .100 cr.

If they are satisfied that the exposure is on the other bank \nthey may assign these exposures the risk weight applicable to banks as detailed \nin paragraph 5.6. \n \n5.15.3         Market related off-balance sheet items  \n \ni) In calculating the risk weighted off-balance sheet credit exposures arising from market \nrelated off-balance sheet items for capital adequacy purposes, the bank should include all \nits market related transactions held in the banking and trading book which give rise to off-\nbalance sheet credit risk.  \n \n \nii) The credit risk on market related off-balance sheet items is the cost to a bank of replacing \nthe cash flow specified by the contract in the event of     counterparty default. This would \ndepend, among other things, upon the maturity of the contract and on the volatility of rates underlying the type of instrument.  \n \niii) Market related off-balance sheet items would include: \na) interest rate contracts \u2013 including single currency interest rate swaps, \nbasis swaps, forward rate agreements, and interest rate futures; \nb) foreign exchange contracts, including contracts involving gold, \u2013 includes \ncross currency swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps), \nforward foreign exchange contracts, currency futures, currency options; \nc)  any other market related contract s specifically allowed by the Reserve \nBank which give rise to credit risk. \niv) Exemption from capital requirements is permitted for  \na) foreign exchange (except gold) contracts which have an original maturity \nof 14 calendar days or less; and  \nb) instruments traded on futures and options exchanges which are subject to \ndaily mark-to-market and margin payments. \nv) The exposures to Central Counter Parties (CCPs), on account of derivatives trading and \nsecurities financing transactions (e.g Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligations- CBLOs, \nRepos) outstanding against them will be assigned zero exposure value for counterparty credit 37 \n risk, as it is presumed that the CCPs\u2019 exposures to  their counterparties are fully collateralised on \na daily basis, thereby providing protection for the CCP\u2019s credit risk exposures. \nvi)      A CCF of 100 per cent will be applied to the banks securities posted as collaterals with \nCCPs and the resultant off-balance sheet exposure will be assigned risk weights appropriate to \nthe nature of the CCPs. In the case of Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), the risk weight will be 20 per cent and for other CCPs, it will be according to the ratings assigned to these entities\n23.    \n \nvii)  The credit equivalent amount of a market related off-balance sheet item, whether held in the \nbanking book or trading book must be determined by the current exposure method.  \n \n5.15.4  Current Exposure Method  \n \n(i) The credit equivalent amount of a market related off-balance sheet transaction calculated \nusing the current exposure method is the sum of current credit exposure and potential \nfuture credit exposure of these contracts. While computing the credit exposure banks \nmay exclude \u2018sold options\u2019, provided the entire premium / fee or any other form of income \nis received / realised.  \n \n(ii) Current credit exposure is defined as the sum of the positive mark-to-market value of \nthese contracts. The Current Exposure Method requires periodical calculation of the \ncurrent credit exposure by marking these contracts to market , thus capturing the current \ncredit exposure.  \n \n(iii) Potential future credit exposure is determined by multiplying the notional principal amount \nof each of these contracts irrespective of whether the contract has a zero, positive or \nnegative mark-to-market value by the relevant add-on factor indicated below according to the nature and residual maturity of the instrument. \n \nTable 9: Credit Conversion Factors for market-related off-balance sheet items \n \nCredit Conversion Factors  \nInterest Rate Contracts Exchange Rate Contracts & \nGold \nOne year or less  0.50 % 2.00 % \n                                            \n23 Please refer to circular DBOD.No. BP.BC.134/21.06.001/2008-09 dated May 26, 2009 38 \n Over one year to five years 1.00 % 10.00 % \nOver five years 3.00 % 15.00 % \n \n \n(iv) For contracts with multiple exchanges of principal, the add-on factors are to be multiplied \nby the number of remaining payments in the contract.   \n \n(v) For contracts that are structured to settle outstanding exposure following specified \npayment dates and where the terms are reset such that the market value of the contract \nis zero on these specified dates, the residual maturity would be set equal to the time until \nthe next reset date. However, in the case of interest rate contracts which have residual \nmaturities of more than one year and meet the above criteria, the CCF or add-on factor is subject to a floor of 1.0 per cent.   \n \n(vi) No potential future credit exposure would be calculated for single currency floating / \nfloating interest rate swaps; the credit exposure on these contracts would be evaluated \nsolely on the basis of their mark-to-market value.  \n \n \n(vii) Potential future exposures should be based on effective rather than apparent notional \namounts. In the event that the stated notional amount is leveraged or enhanced by the \nstructure of the transaction, banks must use the effective notional amount when \ndetermining potential future exposure. For example, a stated notional amount of USD 1 million with payments based on an internal rate of two times the BPLR would have an \neffective notional amount of USD 2 million.\n24 \n \n5.15.5       Failed transactions  \n \ni) With regard to unsettled securities and foreign exchange transactions, banks are \nexposed to counterparty credit risk from trade date, irrespective of the booking or the \naccounting of the transaction. Banks are encouraged to develop, implement and improve \nsystems for tracking and monitoring the credit risk exposure arising from unsettled \ntransactions as appropriate for producing management information that facilitates action \non a timely basis. \n                                            \n24 Please refer to circular  DBOD.No. BP.BC.31/21.04.157/2008-09 dated August 8, 2008 39 \n ii) Banks must closely monitor securities and foreign exchange transactions that have failed, \nstarting from the day they fail for producing management information that facilitates action \non a timely basis.  Failed transactions give rise to risk of delayed settlement or delivery.  \niii) Failure of transactions settled through a deliv ery-versus-payment syst em (DvP), providing \nsimultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose banks to a risk of loss on the \ndifference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the \ntransaction valued at current market price (i.e. positive current exposure). Failed \ntransactions where cash is paid without receipt of the corresponding receivable \n(securities, foreign currencies, or gold,) or, conversely, deliverables were delivered \nwithout receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non-DvP, or free-delivery) expose \nbanks to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or deliverables delivered. Therefore, a capital charge is required for failed transactions and must be calculated as \nunder. The following capital treatment is applicable to all failed transactions, including \ntransactions through recognised clearing houses. Repurchase and reverse-repurchase \nagreements as well as securities lending and borrowing that have failed to settle are excluded from this capital treatment. \niv) For DvP Transactions  \u2013 If the payments have not yet taken place five business days after \nthe settlement date, banks are required to calculate a capital charge  by multiplying the \npositive current exposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor as under. In order to capture the information, banks will need to upgrade their information systems in order to track the number of days after the agreed settlement date and calculate the \ncorresponding capital charge. \nNumber of working days after \nthe agreed settlement date Corresponding \nrisk multiplier \n(in per cent) \nFrom 5 to 15 9 \nFrom 16 to 30 50 \nFrom 31 to 45 75 \n46 or more 100 \n \nv) For non-DvP transactions (free deliveries)  after the first contractual payment / delivery \nleg, the bank that has made the payment will tr eat its exposure as a loan if the second leg \nhas not been received by the end of the business day. If the dates when two payment \nlegs are made are the same according to the time zones where each payment is made, it \nis deemed that they are settled on the same day. For example, if a bank in Tokyo 40 \n transfers Yen on day X (Japan Standard Time) and receives corresponding US Dollar via \nCHIPS on day X (US Eastern Standard Time), the settlement is deemed to take place on the same value date. Banks shall compute the capital requirement using the counterparty \nrisk weights prescribed in these guidelines. However, if five business days after the \nsecond contractual payment / delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the bank that has made the first payment leg will deduct from capital the full amount of the value transferred plus replacement cost, if any. This treatment will apply until the second payment / delivery leg is effectively made. \n \n5.16 Securitisation Exposures \n5.16.1 General \n \ni) A securitisation transaction, which meets the minimum requirements, listed in Annex 7  \n(extracted from the \u2018Guidelines on Securitisation of Standard Assets\u2019, issued vide circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.60/ 21.04.048/ 2005-06 dated February 1, 2006), would qualify for the following prudential treatment of securitisation exposures for capital adequacy purposes. Banks\u2019 exposures to a securitisation transaction, referred to as securitisation exposures, \ncan include, but are not restricted to the following: as investor, as credit enhancer, as \nliquidity provider, as underwriter, as provider  of credit risk mitigants. Cash collaterals \nprovided as credit enhancements shall also be  treated as securitisation exposures. The \nterms used in this section with regard to securitisation shall be as defined in the above \nguidelines. Further, the following definitions shall be applicable: \na) A \u2018credit enhancing interest only strip (I/Os)\u2019 \u2013 an on-balance sheet \nexposure that is recorded by the originator, which (i) represents a \nvaluation of cash flows related to future margin income to be derived from \nthe underlying exposures, and (ii) is subordinated to the claims of other \nparties to the transaction in terms of priority of repayment.  \nb) \u2018Implicit support\u2019 \u2013 the support provided by a bank to a securitisation in \nexcess of its predetermined contractual obligation.  \nc) A \u2018gain-on-sale\u2019 \u2013 any profit realised at the time of sale of the securitised \nassets to SPV.  \nii) Banks are required to hold regulatory capital against all of their securitisation exposures, \nincluding those arising from the provision of credit risk mitigants to a securitisation \ntransaction, investments in asset-backed securities, retention of a subordinated tranche, and extension of a liquidity facility or credit enhancement, as set forth in the following 41 \n                                            paragraphs. Repurchased securitisation exposures must be treated as retained \nsecuritisation exposures. .  \niii) An originator in a securitisation transaction which does not meet the minimum \nrequirements prescribed in the guidelines dated February 1, 2006 and therefore does not \nqualify for de-recognition shall hold capital against all of the exposures associated with the securitisation transaction as if they had not been securitised\n25. Additionally, the \noriginator shall deduct any \u2018gain on sale\u2019 on such transaction from Tier I capital.  \niv) Operational criteria for credit analysis \n \nIn addition to the conditions specified in the RBI Guidelines dated February 1, \n2006 on Securitisation of stan dard assets in order to qualify for de-recognition of \nassets securitised, the bank  must have th e information specified in paragraphs \n(a) through (c) below. \n \na) As a general rule, a bank must, on an ongoing basis, have a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the risk characteristi cs of its individual securitisation \nexposures, whether on balance sheet or off balance sheet, as well as the \nrisk characteristics of the pools unde rlying its securiti sation exposures. \n \nb) Banks must be able to access performance information on the underlying \npools on an on-going basis in a timely manner. Such information may \ninclude, as appropriate: exposure type; percentage of loans 30, 60 and \n90 days past due; default rates; prepay ment rates; loans in foreclosure; \nproperty type; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of \ncreditworthiness; average loan-to- value ratio; and industry and \ngeographic diversification.  \n \nc) A bank must have a thorough understandi ng of all structural features of a \nsecuritisation transaction that would materially impact the performance \nof the bank\u2019s exposures to the tran saction, such as the contractual \nwaterfall and waterfall-related trigge rs, credit enhancements, liquidity \nenhancements, market value triggers , and deal-specific definitions of \ndefault. \n \n25 For example: If in a securitisation tr ansaction of Rs.100, the pool consists of 80 per cent of AAA securities, 10 per \ncent of BB securities and 10 per cent of unrated securities and the transaction does not m eet the true sale criterion, \nthen the originator will be deemed to be holding all the ex posures in that transaction. Consequently, the AAA rated \nsecurities will attract a risk weight of 20 per cent and the face value of the BB rated securities and the unrated \nsecurities will be deducted. Thus the consequent impact on the capital will be Rs.21.44 (16*9 % + 20). 42 \n  \n5.16.2 Deduction of securitisation exposures from capital funds  \ni) When a bank is required to deduct a securitisation exposure from regulatory capital, the \ndeduction must be made 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from Tier II, except \nwhere expressly provided otherwise. Deductions from capital may be calculated net of \nany specific provisions maintained against the relevant securitisation exposures.  \nii) Credit enhancements, including credit enhancing I/Os (net of the gain-on-sale that shall \nbe deducted from Tier I as specified below) and cash collaterals, which are required to be \ndeducted must be deducted 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from Tier II.   \niii) Banks shall deduct from Tier I capital any \u201cgain-on-sale\u201d, if permitted to be recognised. \nHowever, in terms of guidelines on securitisation of standard assets, banks are allowed to amortise the profit over the period of the securities issued by the SPV. The amount of \nprofit thus recognised in the P & L Account through amortisation, need not be deducted. \niv) Any rated securitisation exposure with a long term rating of \u2018B+ and below\u2019 when not held \nby an originator, and a long term rating of \u2018BB+ and below\u2019 when held by the originator \nshall be deducted 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from Tier II capital.  \nv) Any unrated securitisation exposure, except an eligible liquidity facility as specified in \nparagraph 5.16.8  should be deducted 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from Tier II \ncapital. In an unrated and ineligible liquidity facility, both the drawn and undrawn portions shall be deducted 50 per cent from Tier I and 50 per cent from Tier II capital. \nvi) The holdings of securities devolved on the originator through underwriting should be sold \nto third parties within three-month period following the acquisition.  In case of failure to \noff-load within the stipulated time limit, any hol ding in excess of 20 per cent of the original \namount of issue, including secondary market purchases, shall be deducted 50 per cent \nfrom Tier I and 50 per cent from Tier II capital. \n5.16.3 Implicit support  \ni) The originator shall not provide any implicit support to investors in a securitisation \ntransaction.  \nii) When a bank is deemed to have provided implicit support to a securitisation:  43 \n a) It must, at a minimum, hold capital against all of the exposures associated \nwith the securitisation transaction as if they had not been securitised.  \nb) Additionally, the bank would need to deduct any gain-on-sale, as defined \nabove, from Tier I capital.  \nc) Furthermore, in respect of securitisation transactions where the bank is \ndeemed to have provided implicit support it is required to disclose publicly that \n(a) it has provided non-contractual support (b) the details of the implicit \nsupport and (c) the impact of the implicit support on the bank\u2019s regulatory \ncapital.  \niii) Where a securitisation transaction contains a clean up call and the clean up call can be \nexercised by the originator in circumstanc es where exercise of the clean up call \neffectively provides credit enhancement, the clean up call shall be treated as implicit \nsupport and the concerned securitisation transaction will attract the above prescriptions.  \n5.16.4       Application of external ratings  \nThe following operational criteria concerning the use of external credit assessments apply:  \ni) A bank must apply external credit assessments from eligible external credit rating \nagencies consistently across a given type of securitisation exposure. Furthermore, a bank \ncannot use the credit assessments issued by one external credit rating agency for one or \nmore tranches and those of another external credit rating agency for other positions \n(whether retained or purchased) within the same securitisation structure that may or may \nnot be rated by the first external credit rating agency. Where two or more eligible external credit rating agencies can be used and these assess the credit risk of the same securitisation exposure differently, paragraphs \n6.7 will apply. \nii) If the CRM provider is not recognised as an eligible guarantor as defined in paragraph \n7.5.5, the covered securitisation exposures should be treated as unrated. \niii) In the situation where a credit risk mitigant  is not obtained by the SPV but rather applied \nto a specific securitisation exposure within a given structure (e.g. ABS tranche), the bank \nmust treat the exposure as if it is unrated and then use the CRM treatment outlined in \nparagraph  7. \niv) The other aspects of application of exter nal credit assessments will be as per guidelines \ngiven in paragraph  6. \nv)  A bank is not permitted to use any external credit assessment for risk 44 \n weighting purposes where the assessm ent is at least partly based on \nunfunded support provided by the bank. For example, if a bank buys an \nABS/MBS where it provides an unf unded securitisation exposure extended \nto the securitisation programme (eg liquidi ty facility or credit enhancement), \nand that exposure plays a role in de termining the credit assessment on the \nsecuritised assets/various tranches of the ABS/MBS, the bank must treat \nthe securitised assets/various tranches of  the ABS/MBS as if these were not \nrated. The bank must continue to hold capital against the other \nsecuritisation exposures it provides (eg ag ainst the liquidity facility and/or \ncredit enhancement). \n \n5.16.5      Risk weighted securitisation exposures  \ni) Banks shall calculate the risk weighted amount of an on-balance sheet securitisation \nexposure by multiplying the principal amount (after deduction of specific provisions) of the \nexposures by the applicable risk weight.   \nii) The risk-weighted asset amount of a securiti sation exposure is computed by multiplying \nthe amount of the exposure by the appropriate risk weight determined in accordance with \nissue specific rating assigned to those exposur es by the chosen external credit rating \nagencies as indicated in the following tables:  \n \nTable 10: Securitisation exposures \u2013 Risk weight mapping to long-term ratings \n \nDomestic rating agencies AAA AA A BBB BB B and below \nor unrated \nRisk weight for banks \nother than originators 20 % 30 % 50 % 100 % 350 % Deduction* \nRisk weight for originator 20 % 30 % 50 % 100 % Deduction* \n*  governed by the provisions of paragraph  5.16.2\niii) The risk-weighted asset amount of a securitisation exposure in respect of MBS backed by \ncommercial real estate exposure, as defined in paragraph 5.11 above, is computed by \nmultiplying the amount of the exposure by the appropriate risk weight determined in \naccordance with issue specific rating assigned to those exposures by the chosen external \ncredit rating agencies as indicated in the following tables:  \n \nTable 10-A: Commercial real estate securitisation exposures \u2013  \nRisk weight mapping to long-term ratings 45 \n  \nDomestic rating \nagencies AAA AA A BBB BB B and below or \nunrated \nRisk weight for banks \nother than originators 100% 100% 100 % 150 % 400 % Deduction* \nRisk weight for \noriginator 100 %  100%  100 % 150 % Deduction* \n* governed by the provisions of paragraph 5.16.2\niv) Banks are not permitted to invest in unrated  securities issued by an SPV as a part of the \nsecuritisation transaction. However, securi tisation exposures assumed by banks which may \nbecome unrated or may be deemed to be unrated, would be deducted for capital adequacy \npurposes in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 5.16.2.   \n \n5.16.6  Off-balance sheet securitisation exposures  \ni) Banks shall calculate the risk weighted amount of a rated off-balance sheet securitisation \nexposure by multiplying the credit equivalent amount of the exposure by the applicable \nrisk weight. The credit equivalent amount should be arrived at by multiplying the principal \namount of the exposure (after deduction of specific provisions) with a 100 per cent CCF, unless otherwise specified.   \nii) If the off-balance sheet exposure is not rated, it must be deducted from capital, except an \nunrated eligible liquidity facility for which the treatment has been specified separately in paragraph 5.16.8.  \n5.16.7  Recognition of credit risk mitigants  \ni) The treatment below applies to a bank that has obtained a credit risk mitigant on a \nsecuritisation exposure. Credit risk mitigant include guarantees and eligible collateral as \nspecified in these guidelines. Collateral in this context refers to that used to hedge the \ncredit risk of a securitisation exposure rather than for hedging the credit risk of the \nunderlying exposures of the securitisation transaction.  \nii) When a bank other than the originator provides credit protection to a securitisation \nexposure, it must calculate a capital requirement on the covered exposure as if it were an \ninvestor in that securitisation. If a bank provides protection to an unrated credit \nenhancement, it must treat the credit protection provided as if it were directly holding the \nunrated credit enhancement.  46 \n iii) Capital requirements for the guaranteed / protected portion will be calculated according to \nCRM methodology for the standardised approach as specified in paragraph 7 below.  \nEligible collateral is limited to that recognised under these guidelines in paragraph 7.3.5.   \nFor the purpose of setting regulatory capital against a maturity mismatch between the \nCRM and the exposure, the capital requirement will be determined in accordance with paragraphs \n7.6. When the exposures being hedged have different maturities, the longest \nmaturity must be used applying the methodology prescribed in paragraphs 7.6.3 & 7.6. 4.  \n \n5.16.8 Liquidity facilities  \n \ni) A liquidity facility will be considered as an \u2018eligible\u2019 facility only if it satisfies all minimum \nrequirements prescribed in the guidelines issued on February 1, 2006. The rated liquidity \nfacilities will be risk weighted or deducted as per the appropriate risk weight determined \nin accordance with the specific rating assigned to those exposures by the chosen ECAIs \nas indicated in the tables presented above.  \nii) The unrated eligible liquidity facilities will be exempted from deductions and treated as \nfollows.   \na) The drawn and undrawn portions of an unrated eligible liquidity facility would \nattract a risk weight equal to the highest risk weight assigned to any of the \nunderlying individual exposures covered by this facility.  \n \nb) The undrawn portion of an unrated eligible liquidity will attract the \nfollowing credit conversion factors  for calculating the credit equivalent \namount: :  \n \ni. 20 per cent for facilities with an original maturity of one year or less, \nor  \n \nii. 50 per cent for facilities with an original maturity of more than one \nyear.  \nb)    The undrawn portion of an unrated  eligible liquidity facility will \nattract   a credit con version factor of 50%. \n \n5.16.9 Re- Securitisation Exposures \nA re-securitisation exposure is a securitisation exposure in which the risk associated with \nan underlying pool of exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying exposures is a securitisation exposure. In addition, an exposure to one or more re-securitisation \nexposures is a re-securitisation exposure. \n  47 \n At present, re-securitisation exposures are not in vogue in India. However, some of the \nIndian banks have invested in CDOs and other similar securitization exposures through \ntheir overseas branches before issuance of circular RBI/2008-09/302.DBOD.No.BP.BC.89 \n/21.04.141/2008-09 dated December 1, 2008. Some of these exposures may be in the \nnature of re-securitisation. For such exp osures, the risk weights would be assigned \nas under:  \n \n \n \nTable 11: Re-securitisation exposures \u2013 Risk weight mapping to long-term ratings \n \nDomestic rating agencies AAA AA A BBB BB B and below \nor unrated \nRisk weight for banks \nother than originators 40 % 60 % 100 % 200 % 650 % Deduction* \nRisk weight for originator 40 % 60 % 100 % 200 % Deduction* \n* governed by the provisions of paragraph  5.16.2\n \nTable 11A: Commercial real estate re-securitisation exposures \u2013  \nRisk weight mapping to long-term ratings \n \nDomestic rating agencies AAA AA A BBB BB and below or unrated \nRisk weight for banks other than originators 200% 200% 200 % 400% Deduction* \nRisk weight for originator 200% 200% 200 % 400% Deduction* \n* governed by the provisions of paragraph 5.16.2\n \nAll other regulatory norms would be applicab le as prescribed above in this paragraph \n( para 5.16).  \n \n6. External credit assessments  \n6.1 Eligible Credit Rating Agencies  \n6.1.1 Reserve Bank has undertaken the detailed process of identifying the eligible credit rating \nagencies, whose ratings may be used by banks for assigning risk weights for credit risk. \nIn line with the provisions of the Revised Framework, where the facility provided by the \nbank possesses rating assigned by an eligible credit rating agency, the risk weight of the \nclaim will be based on this rating.  48 \n 6.1.2 In accordance with the principles laid down in the Revised Framework, the Reserve Bank \nof India has decided that banks may use the ratings of the following domestic credit rating \nagencies (arranged in alphabetical order) for the purposes of risk weighting their claims \nfor capital adequacy purposes: \na) Credit Analysis and Research Limited; \nb) CRISIL Limited; \nc) FITCH India; and  \nd) ICRA Limited. \n6.1.2.1 The Reserve Bank of India has decided that banks may use the ratings of the \nfollowing international credit rating agencies (arranged in alphabetical order) for the \npurposes of risk weighting their claims for capital adequacy purposes where specified: \na.      Fitch; \nb.     Moodys; and \nc.     Standard & Poor\u2019s \n \n6.2        Scope of application of external ratings \n6.2.1 Banks should use the chosen credit rating agencies and their ratings consistently for \neach type of claim, for both risk weighting and risk management purposes. Banks will not be \nallowed to \u201ccherry pick\u201d the assessments prov ided by different credit rating agencies. If a bank \nhas decided to use the ratings of some of the chosen credit rating agencies for a given type of claim, it can use only  the ratings of those credit rating agencies, despite the fact that some of \nthese claims may be rated by other chosen credit rating agencies whose ratings the bank has \ndecided not to use Banks shall not use one agency\u2019s rating for one corporate bond, while using \nanother agency\u2019s rating for another exposure to the same counter-party, unless the respective exposures are rated by only one of the chosen credit rating agencies, whose ratings the bank has decided to use. External assessments for one entity within a corporate group cannot be \nused to risk weight other entities within the same group.  \n6.2.2 Banks must disclose the names of the credit rating agencies that they use for the risk \nweighting of their assets, the risk weights associated with the particular rating grades as determined by Reserve Bank through the mapping process for each eligible credit rating agency \nas well as the aggregated risk weighted assets as required vide \nTable DF-5 .  \n6.2.3 To be eligible for risk-weighting purposes, the external credit assessment must take into \naccount and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to all 49 \n payments owed to it. For example, if a bank is  owed both principal and interest, the assessment \nmust fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with timely repayment of both \nprincipal and interest. \n6.2.4 To be eligible for risk weighting purposes, the rating should be in force and confirmed from the monthly bulletin of the concerned rating agency. The rating agency should have reviewed the rating at least once during the previous 15 months. \n6.2.5 An eligible credit assessment must be publicly available. In other words, a rating must be published in an accessible form and included in the external credit rating agency\u2019s transition \nmatrix. Consequently, ratings that are made available only to the parties to a transaction do not \nsatisfy this requirement. \n6.2.6 For assets in the bank\u2019s portfolio that have contractual maturity less than or equal to one \nyear, short term ratings accorded by the chos en credit rating agencies would be relevant. For \nother assets which have a contractual maturity of more than one year, long term ratings \naccorded by the chosen credit rating agencies would be relevant.  \n6.2.7 Cash credit exposures tend to be generally  rolled over and also tend to be drawn on an \naverage for a major portion of the sanctioned limits. Hence, even though a cash credit exposure \nmay be sanctioned for period of one year or less, these exposures should be reckoned as long \nterm exposures and accordingly the long term ratings accorded by the chosen credit rating \nagencies will be relevant. Similarly, banks may use long-term ratings of a counterparty as a proxy for an unrated short- term exposure on the same counterparty subject to strict compliance with the requirements for use of multiple rating assessments and applicability of issue rating to \nissuer / other claims as indicated in paragraphs 6.4, 6.5, 6.7 and 6.8 below. \n6.3      Mapping process \nThe Revised Framework recommends development of  a mapping process to assign the ratings \nissued by eligible credit rating agencies to the risk weights available under the Standardised risk \nweighting framework. The mapping process is r equired to result in a risk weight assignment \nconsistent with that of the level of credit risk. A mapping of the credit ratings awarded by the \nchosen domestic credit rating agencies has been furnished below in paragraphs 6.4.1 and 6.5.4, which should be used by banks in assigning risk weights to the various exposures.  50 \n 6.4      Long term ratings \n6.4.1 On the basis of the above factors as well as the data made available by the rating \nagencies, the ratings issued by the chosen domestic credit rating agencies have been mapped \nto the appropriate risk weights applicable as per the Standardised approach under the Revised \nFramework. The rating-risk weight mapping furnished in the Table below shall be adopted by all banks in India: \n \n \n \nTable 12: Risk weight mapping of Long term Ratings of the chosen domestic rating agencies \n \nLong term ratings of the chosen \ncredit rating agencies  \noperating in India  Standardised \napproach risk \nweights  \n(in per cent) \nAAA 20 \nAA 30 \nA 50 \n BBB 100 \nBB & below 150 \nUnrated 100 \n6.4.2 Where \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d notation is attached to the rating, the corresponding main rating category \nrisk weight should be used. For example, A+ or A- would be considered to be in the A rating \ncategory and assigned 50 per cent risk weight. \n6.4.3 If an issuer has a long-term exposure with an external long term rating that warrants a \nrisk weight of 150 per cent, all unrated claims on the same counter-party, whether short-term or long-term, should also receive a 15 0 per cent risk weight, unless the bank uses recognised credit \nrisk mitigation techniques for such claims. \n6.5   Short term ratings \n6.5.1   For risk-weighting purposes, short-term ratings are deemed to be issue-specific. They can only be used to derive risk weights for claims arising from the rated facility. They cannot be generalised to other short-term claims. In no event can a short-term rating be used to support a \nrisk weight for an unrated long-term claim. Short-term assessments may only be used for short-\nterm claims against banks and corporates. \n \n \n6.5.2    Notwithstanding the above restriction on using an issue specific short term rating for \nother short term exposures, the following broad principles will apply. The unrated short term 51 \n claim on counterparty will attract a risk weight of at least one level higher than the risk weight \napplicable to the rated short term claim on that counter-party. If a short-term rated facility to counterparty attracts a 20 per cent or a 50 per cent risk-weight, unrated short-term claims to the \nsame counter-party cannot attract a risk weight lower than 30 per cent or 100 per cent \nrespectively. \n \n6.5.3    Similarly, if an issuer has a short-term  exposure with an external short term rating that \nwarrants a risk weight of 150 per cent, all unrated claims on the same counter-party, whether \nlong-term or short-term, should also receive a 150 per cent risk weight, unless the bank uses \nrecognised credit risk mitigation techniques for such claims. \n \n6.5.4     In respect of the issue specific short term ratings the following risk weight mapping shall \nbe adopted by banks: \n \n \n     Table 13 : Risk weight Mapping of Short Term  Ratings of the Domestic Rating Agencies \n \nCARE  CRISIL Fitch ICRA   \nPR1+ P1+ F1+(ind) A1+ 20 % \nPR1 P1 F1(ind) A1 30 % \nPR2 P2 F2(ind) A2 50 % \nPR3 P 3 F3 (ind) A3 100 % \nPR4 & PR5 P 4 & P5 F4/F5 (ind) A4 / A5 150 % \nUnrated Unrated Unrated Unrated 100 % \n \n6.5.5 Where \u201c+\u201d or \u201c-\u201d notation is attached to the rating, the corresponding main rating category \nrisk weight should be used for PR2/ P2/ F2/ A2 and below, unless specified otherwise. For \nexample, P2+ or P2- would be considered to be in the P2 rating category and assigned 50 per cent risk weight. \n6.5.6 The above risk weight mapping of both long term and short term ratings of the chosen \ndomestic rating agencies would be reviewed annually by the Reserve Bank. \n6.6 Use of unsolicited ratings \nA rating would be treated as solicited only if the issuer of the instrument has requested the credit 52 \n                                            rating agency for the rating and has accepted the rating assigned by the agency. As a general \nrule, banks should use only solicited rating from the chosen credit rating agencies. No \nratings issued by the credit rating agencies on an unsolicited basis should be considered for risk \nweight calculation as per the Standardised Approach.  \n6.7        Use of multiple rating assessments \n \nBanks shall be guided by the following in respect of exposures / obligors having multiple ratings \nfrom the chosen credit rating agencies chosen by the bank for the purpose of risk weight \ncalculation: \n(i) If there is only one rating by a chosen credit rating agency for a particular claim, \nthat rating would be used to determine the risk weight of the claim. \n(ii) If there are two ratings accorded by chosen credit rating agencies that map into \ndifferent risk weights, the higher risk weight should be applied. \n(iii) If there are three or more ratings accorded by chosen credit rating agencies with \ndifferent risk weights, the ratings corresponding to the two lowest risk weights \nshould be referred to and the higher of those two risk weights should be applied. \ni.e., the second lowest risk weight. \n6.8       Applicability of issue rating to issuer/ other claims  \nWhere a bank invests in a particular issue that has an issue specific rating by a chosen credit \nrating agency the risk weight of the claim will be based on this assessment. Where the bank\u2019s \nclaim is not an investment in a specific assessed issue, the following general principles will apply: \n(i) In circumstances where the borrower has  a specific assessment for an issued \ndebt - but the bank\u2019s claim is not an investment in this particular debt - the rating \napplicable to the specific debt (where the rating maps into a risk weight lower than \nthat which applies to an unrated claim) may be applied to the bank\u2019s unassessed \nclaim only if this claim ranks pari passu or senior to the specific rated debt in all \nrespects and the maturity of the unassessed claim is not later than the maturity of \nthe rated claim,26 except where the rated claim is a short term obligation as \nspecified in paragraph 6.5.2. If not, the rating applicable to the specific debt cannot be used and the unassessed claim will receive the risk weight for unrated \n \n26 In a case where a short term claim on a counterparty is rated as P1+ and a long term claim on the same \ncounterparty is rated as AAA, then a bank may assign a 30 per cent risk weight to an unrated short term claim and 20 \nper cent risk weight to an unrated long term claim on that counterparty where the seniority of the claim ranks pari-\npassu with the rated claims and the maturity of the unrated cl aim is not later than the rated claim.  In a similar case \nwhere a short term claim is rated P1+ and a long term claim is rated A, the bank may assign 50 per cent risk weight t \nan unrated short term or long term claim . 53 \n claims.  \n(ii) If either the issuer or single issue has been assigned a rating which maps into a \nrisk weight equal to or higher than that which applies to unrated claims, a claim on \nthe same counterparty, which is unrated by any chosen credit rating agency, will \nbe assigned the same risk weight as is applicable to the rated exposure, if this \nclaim ranks pari passu  or junior to the rated exposure in all respects.  \n \n(iii) Where a bank intends to extend an issuer  or an issue specific rating assigned by \na chosen credit rating agency to any other exposure which the bank has on the \nsame counterparty and which meets the above criterion, it should be extended to \nthe entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to that \nexposure i.e., both principal and interest.  \n(iv) With a view to avoiding any double counting of credit enhancement factors, no \nrecognition of credit risk mitigation techniques should be taken into account if the \ncredit enhancement is already reflected in the issue specific rating accorded by a \nchosen credit rating agency relied upon by the bank. \n(v) Where unrated exposures are risk weighted based on the rating of an equivalent \nexposure to that borrower, the general rule is that foreign currency ratings would \nbe used only for exposures in foreign currency.  \n \n7. Credit Risk Mitigation  \n \n7.1 General principles  \n7.1.1 Banks use a number of techniques to mitigate the credit risks to which they are \nexposed. For example, exposures may be collateralised in whole or in part by cash or securities, \ndeposits from the same counterparty, guarantee of a third party, etc.  The revised approach to \ncredit risk mitigation allows a wider range of credit risk mitigants to be recognised for regulatory capital purposes than is permitted under the 1988 Framework provided these techniques meet \nthe requirements for legal certainty as described in paragraph \n7.2 below. Credit risk mitigation \napproach as detailed in this section is applicable to the banking book exposures. This will also \nbe applicable for calculation of the counterparty risk charges for OTC derivatives and repo-style \ntransactions booked in the trading book.  \n7.1.2 The general principles applicable to use of credit risk mitigation techniques are as \nunder: \n(i) No transaction in which Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) techniques are used should \nreceive a higher capital requirement than an otherwise identical transaction where 54 \n such techniques are not used. \n(ii) The effects of CRM will not be double counted. Therefore, no additional \nsupervisory recognition of CRM for regulatory capital purposes will be granted on \nclaims for which an issue-specific rating is used that already reflects that CRM.  \n(iii) Principal-only ratings will not be allowed within the CRM framework.  \n(iv) While the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it \nsimultaneously may increase other risks (residual risks). Residual risks include \nlegal, operational, liquidity and market risks. Therefore, it is imperative that banks \nemploy robust procedures and processes to control these risks, including \nstrategy; consideration of the underlying credit; valuation; policies and \nprocedures; systems; control of roll-off risks; and management of concentration risk arising from the bank\u2019s use of CRM techniques and its interaction with the \nbank\u2019s overall credit risk profile. Where these risks are not adequately controlled, \nReserve Bank may impose additional capital charges or take other supervisory \nactions. The disclosure requirements prescribed in \nTable DF-6  (paragraph 10 \u2013 \nMarket Discipline) must also be observed for banks to obtain capital relief in \nrespect of any CRM techniques. \n7.2 Legal Certainty \nIn order for banks to obtain capital relief for any use of CRM techniques, the following minimum \nstandards for legal documentation must be met. All documentation used in collateralised \ntransactions and guarantees must be binding on all parties and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Banks must have conducted sufficient legal review, which should be well documented, to verify this. Such verification should have a well founded legal basis for reaching \nthe conclusion about the binding nature and enforceability of the documents. Banks should also \nundertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability.  \n \n7.3      Credit risk mitigation techniques - Collateralised transactions \n7.3.1 A collateralised transaction is one in which: \n(i) banks have a credit exposure and that credit exposure is hedged in whole or in \npart by collateral posted by a counterparty or by a third party on behalf of the \ncounterparty. Here, \u201ccounterparty\u201d is used to denote a party to whom a bank has \nan on- or off-balance sheet credit exposure.  \n(ii) banks have a specific lien on the collateral and the requirements of legal certainty \nare met. 55 \n 7.3.2 Overall framework and minimum conditions  \nThe Revised Framework allows banks to adopt either the simple approach, which, similar to the \n1988 Accord, substitutes the risk weighting of the collateral for the risk weighting of the \ncounterparty for the collateralised portion of the exposure (generally subject to a 20 per cent \nfloor), or the comprehensive approach, which allows fuller offset of collateral against exposures, by effectively reducing the exposure amount by the value ascribed to the collateral. Banks in \nIndia shall adopt the Comprehensive Approach, which allows fuller offset of collateral against \nexposures, by effectively reducing the exposure am ount by the value ascribed to the collateral. \nUnder this approach, banks, which take eligible financial collateral (e.g., cash or securities, more specifically defined below), are allowed to reduce their credit exposure to a counterparty when calculating their capital requirements to take account of the risk mitigating effect of the collateral.  Credit risk mitigation is allowed only on an account-by-account basis, even within regulatory \nretail portfolio. However, before capital relief will be granted the standards set out below must be \nmet:   \n(i) In addition to the general requirements for legal certainty, the legal mechanism by \nwhich collateral is pledged or transferred must ensure that the bank has the right \nto liquidate or take legal possession of it, in a timely manner, in the event of the \ndefault, insolvency or bankruptcy (or one or more otherwise-defined credit events \nset out in the transaction documentation) of the counterparty (and, where \napplicable, of the custodian holding the collateral). Furthermore banks must take \nall steps necessary to fulfill those requirements under the law applicable to the \nbank\u2019s interest in the collateral for obtaining and maintaining an enforceable \nsecurity interest, e.g. by registering it with a registrar. \n(ii) In order for collateral to provide protection, the credit quality of the counterparty \nand the value of the collateral must not have a material positive correlation. For \nexample, securities issued by the counter party - or by any related group entity - \nwould provide little protection and so would be ineligible.  \n(iii) Banks must have clear and robust procedures for the timely liquidation of \ncollateral to ensure that any legal conditions required for declaring the default of the counterparty and liquidating the collateral are observed, and that collateral can \nbe liquidated promptly.  \n(iv) Where the collateral is held by a custodian, banks must take reasonable steps to \nensure that the custodian segregates the collateral from its own assets. \n7.3.3 A capital requirement will be applied to a bank on either side of the collateralised \ntransaction: for example, both repos and reverse repos will be subject to capital requirements. 56 \n Likewise, both sides of securities lending and borrowing transactions will be subject to explicit \ncapital charges, as will the posting of securities in connection with a derivative exposure or other borrowing. \n7.3.4 The comprehensive approach  \ni) In the comprehensive approach, when taking collateral, banks will need to calculate their \nadjusted exposure to a counterparty for capital adequacy purposes in order to take \naccount of the effects of that collateral. Banks are required to adjust both the amount of \nthe exposure to the counterparty and the value of any collateral received in support of that counterparty to take account of possible future fluctuations in the value of either, \noccasioned by market movements. These adjustments are referred to as \u2018haircuts\u2019. The \napplication of haircuts will produce volatility adjusted amounts for both exposure and \ncollateral. The volatility adjusted amount for the exposure will be higher than the \nexposure and the volatility adjusted amount for the collateral will be lower than the collateral, unless either side of the transaction is cash. In other words, the \u2018haircut\u2019 for the exposure will be a premium factor and the \u2018haircut\u2019 for the collateral will be a discount \nfactor.  It may be noted that the purpose underlying the application of haircut is to capture \nthe market-related volatility inherent in the value of exposures as well as of the eligible financial collaterals. Since the value of credit exposures acquired by the banks in the course of their banking operations, would not be subject to market volatility, (since the loan disbursal / investment would be a \u201ccash\u201d transaction) though the value of eligible \nfinancial collateral would be, the haircut stipulated in Table-14 would apply in respect of \ncredit transactions only to the eligible collateral but not to the credit exposure of the bank.  On the other hand, exposures of banks, arising out of repo-style transactions would \nrequire upward adjustment for volatility, as the value of security sold/lent/pledged in the \nrepo transaction, would be subject to market volatility. Hence, such exposures shall \nattract haircut.   \nii) Additionally where the exposure and collateral are held in different currencies an \nadditional downwards adjustment must be made to the volatility adjusted collateral \namount to take account of possible future fluctuations in exchange rates. \niii) Where the volatility-adjusted exposure amount is greater than the volatility-adjusted \ncollateral amount (including any further adjustment for foreign exchange risk), banks shall \ncalculate their risk-weighted assets as the difference between the two multiplied by the 57 \n risk weight of the counterparty. The framewor k for performing calculations of capital \nrequirement is indicated in paragraph 7.3.6 . \n \n7.3.5     Eligible financial collateral  \nThe following collateral instruments are eligible for recognition in the comprehensive approach: \n \n(i) Cash  (as well as certificates of deposit or comparable instruments, including fixed deposit \nreceipts, issued by the lending bank) on deposit with the bank which is incurring the \ncounterparty exposure. \n \n(ii) Gold : Gold would include both bullion and jewellery. However, the value of the \ncollateralised jewellery should be arrived at after notionally converting these to 99.99 \npurity.  \n \n(iii) Securities  issued by Central and State Governments \n \n(iv) Kisan Vikas Patra  and National Savings Certificates provided no lock-in period is \noperational and if they can be encashed within the holding period. \n \n(v) Life insurance  policies with a declared surrender value of an insurance company which is \nregulated by an insurance sector regulator.  \n \n(vi) Debt securities  rated by a chosen Credit Rating Agency in respect of which the banks \nshould be sufficiently confident about the market liquidity27 where these are either: \na)   Attracting 100 per cent or lesser risk weight i.e., rated at least BBB(-) \nwhen issued by public sector entities and other entities (including banks and \nPrimary Dealers); or \n \nb)    Attracting 100 per cent or lesser risk weight i.e., rated at least PR3 / \n       P3/F3/A3 for short-term debt instruments. \n \n \nvii) Debt securities  not rated by a chosen Credit Rating Agency in respect of which the banks \nshould be sufficiently confident about the market liquidity  where these are: \na) issued by a bank; and \nb) listed on a recognised exchange; and \n                                            \n27 A debenture would meet the test of liqui dity if it is traded on a recognised stock exchange(s) on at least 90 per cent \nof the trading days during the preceding 365 days. Furt her, liquidity can be evidenced in the trading during the \nprevious one month in the recognised stock exchange if there are a  minimum of 25  trades of marketable lots in \nsecurities of each issuer.  58 \n c) classified as senior debt; and \nd) all rated issues of the same seniority by the issuing bank are rated at least \nBBB(-) or PR3/P3/F3/A3 by a chosen Credit Rating Agency; and  \ne) the bank holding the securities as collateral has no information to suggest \nthat the issue justifies a rating  below BBB(-) or PR3/P3/F3/A3 (as \napplicable) and; \nf) Banks should be sufficiently confident about the market liquidity of the \nsecurity. \n \nviii) Units of Mutual Funds regulated by the securities regulator of the jurisdiction of  the \nbank\u2019s operation mutual funds where: \n \na) a price for the units is publicly quoted daily i.e., where the daily NAV is \navailable in public domain; and \nb) Mutual fund is limited to investing in the instruments listed in this \nparagraph. \n7.3.6       Calculation of capital requirement  \nFor a collateralised transaction, the exposure amount after risk mitigation is calculated as \nfollows: \nE*  =  max {0, [E x (1 + H e) - C x (1 - H c - H fx)]} \n                where: \nE* =   the exposure value after risk mitigation \nE  =   current value of the exposure for which the collateral qualifies as a risk      \n          mitigant \nHe  =  haircut appropriate to the exposure \nC =    the current value of the collateral received \nHc =   haircut appropriate to the collateral \nHfx =  haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the collateral and    \n          exposure \nThe exposure amount after risk mitigation (i.e., E*) will be multiplied by the risk weight of the \ncounterparty to obtain the risk-weighted asset amount for the collateralised transaction. \nIllustrative examples calculating the effect of Credit Risk Mitigation is furnished in Annex 8. 59 \n  \n7.3.7 Haircuts  \ni) In principle, banks have two ways of calculating the haircuts: (i) standard supervisory \nhaircuts, using parameters set by the Basel Committee, and (ii) own-estimate haircuts, \nusing banks\u2019 own internal estimates of market price volatility. Banks in India shall use \nonly the standard supervisory haircuts for both the exposure as well as the collateral. \n \nii) The Standard Supervisory Haircuts (assuming daily mark-to-market, daily re-margining \nand a 10 business-day holding period)28,   expressed as percentages, would be as \nfurnished in Table 14. \n \niii)  The ratings indicated in Table \u2013 14 represent the ratings assigned by the domestic rating \nagencies. In the case of exposures toward debt securities issued by foreign Central \nGovernments and foreign corporates, the haircut may be based on ratings of the \ninternational rating agencies, as indicated in Table 15. \n \n \niv) Sovereign will include Reserve Bank of India, DICGC and CGTSI, which are eligible for \nzero per cent risk weight. \n \nv)    Banks may apply a zero haircut for eligible collateral where it is a National Savings \nCertificate, Kisan Vikas Patras, surrender value of insurance policies and banks\u2019 own \ndeposits. \n \nvi) The standard supervisory haircut for currency risk where exposure and collateral are \ndenominated in different currencies is eight per cent (also based on a 10-business day holding period and daily mark-to-market) \n \n \n \nTable \u2013 14: Standard Supervisory Haircuts for Sovereign and other securities which \nconstitute Exposure and Collateral \n \n \nSl.

(Since, at present, the repos are allowed only in the \ncase of Government securities, the banks are not likely to have any exposure which will attract the provisions of this clause. However, this would be relevant, if in future, \nrepos/security lending transactions are permitted in the case of unrated corporate \nsecurities). \nviii)  Where the collateral is a basket of assets, the haircut on the basket will be,  \ni iH a H\ni\u2211= \nwhere a i is the weight of the asset (as measured by the amount/value of the asset in units \nof currency) in the basket and Hi , the haircut applicable to that asset. \n \nix) Adjustment for different holding periods   \nFor some transactions, depending on the nature and frequency of the revaluation and \nremargining provisions, different holding periods (other than 10 business-days )  are \nappropriate. The framework for collateral haircuts distinguishes between repo-style \ntransactions (i.e. repo/reverse repos and securities lending/borrowing), \u201cother capital-market-driven transactions\u201d (i.e. OTC derivatives transactions and margin lending) and \nsecured lending. In capital-market-driven transactions and repo-style transactions, the \ndocumentation contains remargining clauses; in secured lending transactions, it generally \ndoes not. In view of different holding periods, in the case of these transactions, the \nminimum holding period shall be taken as indicated below:  \n \nTransaction type Minimum holding \nPeriod Condition \nRepo-style transaction  five business days  daily remargining  \nOther capital market \ntransactions ten business days  daily remargining  \nSecured lending twenty business days  daily revaluation  \n \n \nThe haircut for the transactions with other than 10 business-days minimum holding \nperiod, as indicated above, will have to be adjusted by scaling up/down the haircut for 10 \nbusiness\u2013days indicated in the Table-14, as per the formula given in paragraph 7.3.7 (xi) below. \n61 \n  \nx)  Adjustment for non-daily mark-to-market or remargining\nIn case  a transaction has  margining frequency  different from daily margining  assumed, \nthe applicable haircut for the transaction will also need to be adjusted by using the formula given in paragraph 7.3.7 (xi) below. \n \nxi) Formula for adjustment for different holding periods and / or non-daily mark \u2013 to \u2013 market \nor remargining   \n \nAdjustment for the variation in holding period and margining / mark \u2013 to \u2013 market, as indicated in paragraph (ix) and (x) above will be done as per the following formula: \n   10) 1 (\n10\u2212 +=M RT NH H  \nwhere: \n \nH      = haircut; \nH10    = 10-business-day standard supervisory haircut for instrument \nNR   = actual number of business days between remargining for capital market       \n           transactions or revaluation for secured transactions. \n \nTM       = minimum holding period for the type of transaction \n \n7.3.8  Capital Adequacy Framework for Repo- /Reverse Repo-style transactions.\n \nThe repo-style transactions also attract capital charge for Counterparty credit risk (CCR), in \naddition to the credit risk and market risk.  The CCR is defined as the risk  of default by the \ncounterparty in a repo-style transaction, resulting in non-delivery of the security lent/pledged/sold \nor non-repayment of the cash. \n \nA.  Treatment in the books of the borrower of funds  \n \ni) Where a bank has borrowed funds by  selling / lending or posting, as collateral, of \nsecurities, the \u2018Exposure\u2019 will be an off-balance sheet exposure equal to the \n'market value' of the securities sold/lent as scaled up after applying appropriate \nhaircut. For the purpose, the haircut as per Table 14 would be used as the basis \nwhich should be applied by using the formula in paragraph 7.3.7 (xi), to reflect \nminimum (prescribed) holding period of five business-days for repo-style \n62 \n 63 \n transactions and the variations, if any, in the frequency of re-margining, from the \ndaily margining assumed for the standard supervisory haircut. The 'off-balance \nsheet exposure' will be converted into 'on-balance sheet' equivalent by applying a \ncredit conversion factor of 100 per cent., as per item 5 in Table 8 of the circular.  \n \nii) The amount of money received will be treated as collateral for the securities \nlent/sold/pledged. Since the collateral is cash, the haircut for it would be zero. \n \niii) The credit equivalent amount arrived at (i) above, net of amount of cash collateral, \nwill attract a risk weight as applicable to the counterparty.  \n \niv) As the securities will come back to the books of the borrowing bank after the repo \nperiod, it will continue to maintain the capital for the credit risk in the securities in \nthe cases where the securities involved in repo are held under HTM category, and \ncapital for market risk in cases where the securities are held under AFS/HFT categories. The capital charge for credit risk / specific risk would be determined \naccording to the credit rating of the issuer of the security. In the case of \nGovernment securities, the capital charge for credit / specific risk will be 'zero'.  \n \nB.  Treatment in the books of the lender of funds  \ni) The amount lent will be treated as on-balance sheet/funded exposure on the \ncounter party, collateralised by the securities accepted under the repo.  \nii) The exposure, being cash, will receive a zero haircut.  \niii) The collateral will be adjusted downwards/marked down as per   applicable haircut.   \niv) The amount of exposure reduced by the adjus ted amount of collateral, will receive a \nrisk weight as applicable to the counterparty, as it is an on- balance sheet exposure.  \nv) The lending bank will not maintain any capital charge for the security received by it \nas collateral during the repo period, since such collateral does not enter its balance \nsheet but is only held as a bailee. \n \n \n7.4 Credit risk mitigation techniques \u2013 On-balance sheet netting \nOn-balance sheet netting is confined to loans/advances and deposits, where banks have legally \nenforceable netting arrangements, involving specific  lien with proof of documentation. They may \ncalculate capital requirements on the basis of net credit exposures subject to the following \nconditions: \nWhere a bank, \na) has a well-founded legal basis for concluding that the netting or offsetting  \nagreement is enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction regardless of whether the 64 \n counterparty is insolvent or bankrupt; \nb) is able at any time to determine the loans/advances and deposits with the same \ncounterparty that are subject to the netting agreement; and               \nc) monitors and controls the relevant exposures on a net basis,  \n \nit may use the net exposure of loans/advances and deposits as the basis for its capital adequacy \ncalculation in accordance with the formula in paragraph 7.3.6. Loans/advances are treated as exposure and deposits as collateral. The haircuts will be zero except when a currency mismatch \nexists. All the requirements contained in paragraph \n7.3.6  and 7.6 will also apply. \n7.5 Credit risk mitigation techniques - Guarantees  \n7.5.1 Where guarantees are direct, explicit, irrevocable and unconditional banks may \ntake account of such credit protection in calculating capital requirements.  \n7.5.2 A range of guarantors are recognised. As under the 1988 Accord, a substitution approach will be applied. Thus only guarantees issued by entities with a lower risk weight than the \ncounterparty will lead to reduced capital charges since the protected portion of the counterparty \nexposure is assigned the risk weight of the guarantor, whereas the uncovered portion retains the risk weight of the underlying counterparty. \n7.5.3 Detailed operational requirements for guarantees eligible for being treated as a CRM are \nas under:  \n7.5.4 Operational requirements for guarantees  \ni) A guarantee (counter-guarantee) must represent a direct claim on the protection provider \nand must be explicitly referenced to specific exposures or a pool of exposures, so that the \nextent of the cover is clearly defined and incontrovertible. The guarantee must be irrevocable; there must be no clause in the contract that would allow the protection provider unilaterally to cancel the cover or that would increase the effective cost of cover as a result \nof deteriorating credit quality in the guaranteed exposure. The guarantee must also be \nunconditional; there should be no clause in the guarantee outside the direct control of the bank that could prevent the protection provider  from being obliged to pay out in a timely \nmanner in the event that the original counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due. \nii) All exposures will be risk weighted after taking into account risk mitigation available in the \nform of guarantees. When a guaranteed exposure is classified as non-performing, the 65 \n guarantee will cease to be a credit risk mitigant and no adjustment would be permissible on \naccount of credit risk mitigation in the form of guarantees. The entire outstanding, net of specific provision and net of realisable value of eligible collaterals / credit risk mitigants, will \nattract the appropriate risk weight. \n7.5.5 Additional operational requirements for guarantees  \nIn addition to the legal certainty requirements in paragraphs 7.2 above, in order for a guarantee \nto be recognised, the following conditions must be satisfied:  \ni) On the qualifying default/non-payment of the counterparty, the bank is able in a timely \nmanner to pursue the guarantor for any monies outstanding under the documentation \ngoverning the transaction. The guarantor may make one lump sum payment of all monies \nunder such documentation to the bank, or the guarantor may assume the future payment \nobligations of the counterparty covered by the guarantee. The bank must have the right to receive any such payments from the guarantor wi thout first having to take legal actions in \norder to pursue the counterparty for payment. \nii) The guarantee is an explicitly documented obligation assumed by the guarantor. \niii) Except as noted in the following sentence, the guarantee covers all types of payments \nthe underlying obligor is expected to make under the documentation governing the \ntransaction, for example notional amount, margin payments etc. Where a guarantee \ncovers payment of principal only, interests and other uncovered payments should be \ntreated as an unsecured amount in accordance with paragraph  \n7.5.6 Range of eligible guarantors (counter-guarantors)  \nCredit protection given by the following entities will be recognised:  \n(i) Sovereigns, sovereign entities (including BIS, IMF, European Central Bank and \nEuropean Community as well as those MDBs referred to in paragraph 5.5, ECGC \nand CGTSI), banks and primary dealers with a lower risk weight than the \ncounterparty;  \n(ii) other entities rated AA (-) or better. This would include guarantee cover provided \nby parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies when they have a lower risk weight \nthan the obligor. The rating of the guarantor should be an entity rating which has \nfactored in all the liabilities and commitments (including guarantees) of the entity. 66 \n 7.5.7 Risk weights  \nThe protected portion is assigned the risk weight of the protection provider. Exposures covered \nby State Government guarantees will attract a risk weight of 20 per cent. The uncovered portion of the exposure is assigned the risk weight of the underlying counterparty.  \n7.5.8 Proportional cover  \nWhere the amount guaranteed, or against which credit protection is held, is less than the amount of the exposure, and the secured and unsecured portions are of equal seniority, i.e. the bank and \nthe guarantor share losses on a pro-rata basis capital relief will be afforded on a proportional \nbasis: i.e. the protected portion of the exposure will receive the treatment applicable to eligible guarantees, with the remainder treated as unsecured. \n7.5.9 Currency mismatches  \nWhere the credit protection is denominated in a currency different from that in which the \nexposure is denominated \u2013 i.e. there is a currency mismatch \u2013 the amount of the exposure \ndeemed to be protected will be reduced by the application of a haircut H FX, i.e., \n                                 \n  G A    =    G x (1- H FX) \nwhere: \n \nG      =    nominal amount of the credit protection \nHFX   =     haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between the credit       \n                protection and underlying obligation. \nBanks using the supervisory haircuts will apply a haircut of eight per cent for currency mismatch.  \n7.5.10 Sovereign guarantees and counter-guarantees  \n \nA claim may be covered by a guarantee that is indirectly counter-guaranteed by a sovereign. \nSuch a claim may be treated as covered by a sovereign guarantee provided that: \n \n(i) the sovereign counter-guarantee covers all credit risk elements of the claim; \n(ii) both the original guarantee and the counter-guarantee meet all operational \nrequirements for guarantees, except that the counter-guarantee need not be \ndirect and explicit to the original claim;   and 67 \n (iii) the cover should be robust and no historical evidence suggests that the \ncoverage of the counter-guarantee is less than effectively equivalent to that of \na direct sovereign guarantee. \n \n7.6 Maturity Mismatch \n7.6.1  For the purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets, a maturity mismatch occurs when the \nresidual maturity of collateral is less than that of the underlying exposure. Where there is a \nmaturity mismatch and the CRM has an original ma turity of less than one year, the CRM is not \nrecognised for capital purposes. In other cases where there is a maturity mismatch, partial \nrecognition is given to the CRM for regulatory capital purposes as detailed below in paragraphs 7.6.2 to 7.6.4. \n  In case of loans collateralised by the  bank\u2019s  own deposits, even if the tenor of \nsuch deposits is less than three months or deposits have maturity mismatch vis-\u00e0-vis the tenor of \nthe loan, the provisions of paragraph 7.6.1 regarding derecognition of collateral would not be \nattracted  provided an explicit consent of the depositor has been  obtained from the depositor \n(i.e, borrower) for adjusting  the maturity proceeds of such deposits against the outstanding loan or for renewal of such deposits till the full repayment of the underlying loan. \n \n7.6.2 Definition of maturity  \nThe maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the collateral should both be defined \nconservatively. The effective maturity of the underlying should be gauged as the longest possible remaining time before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking into account any \napplicable grace period. For the collateral, embedded options which may reduce the term of the \ncollateral should be taken into account so that the shortest possible effective maturity is used. The maturity relevant here is the residual maturity.  \n \n7.6.3 Risk weights for maturity mismatches  \nAs outlined in paragraph 7.6.1, collateral with maturity mismatches are only recognised when \ntheir original maturities are greater than or equal to one year. As a result, the maturity of \ncollateral for exposures with original maturities of less than one year must be matched to be \nrecognised. In all cases, collateral with maturity mismatches will no longer be recognised when they have a residual maturity of three months or less. 68 \n 7.6.4    When there is a maturity mismatch with recognised credit risk mitigants (collateral,     on-\nbalance sheet netting and guarantees) the following adjustment will be applied: \nPa   =   P x ( t- 0.25 ) \u00f7 ( T- 0.25)  \n         where: \nPa    =   value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch \nP      =   credit protection (e.g. collateral amount, guarantee amount)   adjusted for \nany haircuts \n \nt       =    min (T, residual maturity of the credit protection arrangement) expressed \nin years \n \nT      =    min (5, residual maturity of the exposure) expressed in years \n \n7.7 Treatment of pools of CRM techniques \nIn the case where a bank has multiple CRM techniques covering a single exposure (e.g. a bank has both collateral and guarantee partially covering an exposure), the bank will be required to subdivide the exposure into portions covered by each type of CRM technique (e.g. portion \ncovered by collateral, portion covered by guarantee) and the risk-weighted assets of each \nportion must be calculated separately. When credit protection provided by a single protection provider has differing maturities, they must be subdivided into separate protection as well. \n8.       Capital charge for Market Risk  \n8.1 Introduction \nMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions \narising from movements in market prices. The market risk positions subject to capital charge requirement are: \n(i) The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the \ntrading book; and  \n(ii) Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout \nthe bank (both banking and trading books). \n \n8.2 Scope and coverage of capital charge for market risks \n8.2.1  These guidelines seek to address the issues involved in computing capital charges for \ninterest rate related instruments in the trading book, equities in the trading book and foreign 69 \n exchange risk (including gold and other precious metals) in both trading and banking books. \nTrading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will include: \n \n(i) Securities included under the Held for Trading category \n(ii) Securities included under the Available for Sale category \n \n(iii) Open gold position limits \n(iv) Open foreign exchange position limits \n(v) Trading positions in derivatives, and  \n(vi) Derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures.  \n \n8.2.2 Banks are required to manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis and ensure that the capital requirements for market risks are being maintained on a continuous \nbasis, i.e. at the close of each business day. Banks are also required to maintain strict risk \nmanagement systems to monitor and control intra-day exposures to market risks. \n8.2.3 Capital for market risk would not be relevant for securities, which have already matured \nand remain unpaid. These securities will attract capital only for credit risk. On completion of 90 \ndays delinquency, these will be treated on par with NPAs for deciding the appropriate risk \nweights for credit risk. \n \n8.3 Measurement of capital charge for interest rate risk \n \n8.3.1 This section describes the framework for measuring the risk of holding or taking positions \nin debt securities and other interest rate related instruments in the trading book. \n \n8.3.2 The capital charge for interest rate related instruments would apply to current market \nvalue of these items in bank's trading book. Since banks are required to maintain capital for market risks on an ongoing basis, they are required to mark to market their trading positions on a \ndaily basis. The current market value will be determined as per extant RBI guidelines on \nvaluation of investments. \n \n \n8.3.3  The minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separately calculated \ncharges, (i) \"specific risk\" charge for each security, which is designed to protect against an \nadverse movement in the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual \nissuer, both for short (short position is not allo wed in India except in derivatives) and long 70 \n positions, and (ii) \" general market risk \" charge towards interest rate risk in the portfolio, where \nlong and short positions (which is not allowed in India except in derivatives) in different securities \nor instruments can be offset. \n \n8.3.4  For the debt securities held under AFS category, in view of the possible longer holding \nperiod and attendant higher specific risk,  the banks shall  hold total capital charge for market \nrisk equal to greater of  (a) or (b) below: \n \na) Specific risk capital charge, computed notionally for the AFS securities treating them as  \nheld under HFT category (as computed according to Table 16: Part A/C/E, as applicable) \nplus  the General Market Risk Capital Charge. \n \nb) Alternative total capital charge for the AFS category computed notionally treating them as \nheld  in the banking book (as computed in accordance with table 16: Part B/D/F, as \napplicable) \n \nA. Specific Risk  \n8.3.5  The capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse movement in \nthe price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual issuer. The specific \nrisk charges for various kinds of exposures would be applied as detailed below: \n \n \nSl.No. Nature of debt securities / issuer  Table to be followed \n \n \na.  \nCentral, State and Foreign Central \nGovernments\u2019  bonds:  \n \n(i) Held in HFT category \n(ii) Held in AFS category \n  \n \n \n                      \nTable 16 \u2013 Part A  \nTable 16 \u2013 Par B \n \n \nb.  \nBanks\u2019 Bonds : \n \n(i) Held in HFT category \n(ii) Held in AFS category \n  \n \n \nTable 16 \u2013 Part C \nTable 16 \u2013 Par D \n \n \nc.  \nCorporate  Bonds and securitised debt:  \n \n(i) Held in HFT category \n(ii) Held in AFS category \n  \n \n \nTable 16 \u2013 Par E \nTable 16 \u2013 Part F \n                                               \n \n 71 \n               \nTable 16 \u2013 Part A   \nSpecific Risk Capital Charge for Sovereign securities issued by \nIndian and foreign sovereigns \u2013 Held by banks under the HFT Category  \nSr. \nNo. Nature of Investment Residual  Maturity Specific risk \ncapital        \n(as  % of \nexposure) \nA.

General Market Risk  \n8.3.7 The capital requirements for general market risk are designed to capture the risk of loss \narising from changes in market interest rates. The capital charge is the sum of four components: 81 \n (i) the net short (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives) or \nlong position in the whole trading book; \n(ii) a small proportion of the matched positions in each time-band (the \u201cvertical \ndisallowance\u201d); \n(iii) a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time-bands (the \n\u201chorizontal disallowance\u201d), and \n(iv) a net charge for positions in options, where appropriate. \n8.3.8   Separate maturity ladders should be used for each currency and capital charges should \nbe calculated for each currency separately and then summed with no offsetting between \npositions of opposite sign.  In the case of thos e currencies in which business is insignificant \n(where the turnover in the respective currency is less than 5 per cent of overall foreign exchange turnover), separate calculations for each currency are not required.  The bank may, instead, slot \nwithin each appropriate time-band, the net long or short position for each currency. However, \nthese individual net positions are to be summed wi thin each time-band, irrespective of whether \nthey are long or short positions, to produce a gross position figure. The gross positions in each time-band will be subject to the assumed change in yield set out in Table-18 with no further offsets.  \n8.3.9 The Basle Committee has suggested two broad methodologies for computation of capital \ncharge for market risks. One is the standardised method and the other is the banks\u2019 internal risk management models method. As banks in India are still in a nascent stage of developing internal \nrisk management models, it has been decided that, to start with, banks may adopt the \nstandardised method. Under the standardised method there are two principal methods of \nmeasuring market risk, a \u201cmaturity\u201d method and a \u201cduration\u201d method. As \u201cduration\u201d method is a more accurate method of measuring interest rate risk, it has been decided to adopt standardised duration method to arrive at the capital charge. Accordingly, banks are required to measure the general market risk charge by calculating the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each position \nseparately.  Under this method, the mechanics are as follows: \n(i) first calculate the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each instrument; \n \n(ii) next apply the assumed change in yield to the modified duration of each \ninstrument between 0.6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the maturity \nof the instrument (see Table - 17) ; 82 \n  \n(iii) slot the resulting  capital charge measures into a maturity ladder with the \nfifteen time bands as set out in Table - 17; \n \n(iv) subject long and short positions (short position is not allowed in India except in \nderivatives) in each time band to a 5 per  cent vertical disallowance designed \nto capture basis risk; and \n \n(v) carry forward the net positions in each time-band for horizontal offsetting \nsubject to the disallowances set out in Table - 18. \n \n \nTable 17 - Duration method \u2013 time bands and assumed changes in yield \n \n \nTime Bands Assumed Change \nin Yield Time Bands Assumed Change \nin Yield \nZone 1  Zone 3  \n1 month or less 1.00 3.6 to 4.3 years  0.75 \n1 to 3 months 1.00 4.3 to 5.7 years  0.70 \n3 to 6 months 1.00 5.7 to 7.3 years  0.65 \n6 to 12 months  1.00 7.3 to 9.3 years  0.60 \nZone 2   9.3 to 10.6 years  0.60 \n1.0 to 1.9 years  0.90 10.6 to 12 years  0.60 \n1.9 to 2.8 years   0.80 12 to 20 years  0.60 \n2.8 to 3.6 years  0.75  \nover 20 years  0.60 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Table 18  - Horizontal Disallowances \n \nZones Time band Within the \nzones Between \nadjacent zones Between zones \n1 and 3 \n1 month or less \n1 to 3 months \n3 to 6 months \n83 \n Zone 1 \n6 to 12 months  40% \n1.0 to 1.9 years  \n1.9 to 2.8 years   Zone 2 \n2.8 to 3.6 years  30% \n3.6 to 4.3 years  \n4.3 to 5.7 years  \n5.7 to 7.3 years  \n7.3 to 9.3 years  \n9.3 to 10.6 years  \n10.6 to 12 years  \n12 to 20 years  Zone 3 \nover 20 years  30%  \n \n \n40% \n \n \n \n \n40%  \n \n \n \n \n \n100% \n \n8.3.10   Interest rate derivatives  \nThe measurement of capital charge for market risks should include all interest rate derivatives \nand off-balance sheet instruments in the trading book and derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures which would react to changes in the interest rates, like FRAs, interest \nrate positions etc. The details of measurement of capital charge for interest rate derivatives are \nfurnished in Annex 9.  \n \n8.4 Measurement of capital charge for equity risk \n \n8.4.1 The capital charge for equities would apply on their current market value in bank\u2019s trading \nbook . Minimum capital requirement to cover the risk of holding or taking positions in equities in \nthe trading book is set out below. This is applied to all instruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to equities but not to non-convertible preference shares (which are covered by the \ninterest rate risk requirements described earlier). The instruments covered include equity shares, \nwhether voting or non-voting, convertible securities that behave like equities, for example: units 84 \n of mutual funds, and commitments to buy or sell equity.  \nSpecific and general market risk  \n8.4.2 Capital charge for specific risk (akin to credit risk) will be 9 per cent and specific risk is \ncomputed on the banks\u2019 gross equity positions (i.e. the sum of all long equity positions and of all short equity positions \u2013 short equity position is, however, not allowed for banks in India). The \ngeneral market risk charge will also be 9 per cent on the gross equity positions. \n8.4.3    Specific Risk Capital Charge for banks\u2019 investment in Security Receipts will be 13.5 per \ncent (equivalent to 150 per cent risk weight). Since the Security Receipts are by and large illiquid and not traded in the secondary market, there will be no General Market Risk Capital Charge on \nthem.(vide mailbox clarification dated January 18, 2010)   \n8.5 Measurement of capital charge for foreign exchange risk  \nThe bank\u2019s net open position in each currency should be calculated by summing: \n\u2022 The net spot position (i.e. all asset items less all liability items, including accrued \ninterest, denominated in the currency in question); \n \n\u2022 The net forward position (i.e. all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid \nunder forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the \nprincipal on currency swaps not included in the spot position); \n \n\u2022 Guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and are likely to be \nirrecoverable; \n \n\u2022 Net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion \nof the reporting bank); \n \n\u2022 Depending on particular accounting conventions in different countries, any other item \nrepresenting a profit or loss in foreign currencies; \n \n\u2022 The net delta-based equivalent of the total book of foreign currency options \n \nForeign exchange open positions and gold open positions are at present risk-weighted at 100 \nper cent. Thus, capital charge for market risks in foreign exchange and gold open position is 9 per cent. These open positions, limits or actual whichever is higher, would continue to attract \ncapital charge at 9 per cent. This capital charge is in addition to the capital charge for credit risk \non the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items pertaining to foreign exchange and gold \ntransactions. 85 \n 8.6   Aggregation of the capital charge for market risks \nAs explained earlier capital charges for specific risk and general market risk are to be computed \nseparately before aggregation.  For computing the total capital charge for market risks, the calculations may be plotted in the following table: \n                                                                    \nProforma\n        (Rs. in crore) \nRisk Category Capital charge \nI.

This guidance would be \napplicable to all positions enumerated in para 8.2.1 above.  It is especially \nimportant for positions without actual market prices or observable \ninputs to valuation, as well as l ess liquid positions which raise \nsupervisory concerns about prudent valuation. The valuation guidance set forth below is not intended to require banks to change valuation \nprocedures for financial reporting purposes.  \n \n \n(ii)       A framework for prudent  valuation practices should at a minimum \ninclude the following: \n \n \n 86 \n 8.7.1.1 Systems and controls \n \nBanks must establish and maintain adequa te systems and controls sufficient to \ngive management and superv isors the confidence that their valuation estimates \nare prudent and reliable. These systems mu st be integrated with other risk \nmanagement systems within the organisati on (such as credit analysis). Such \nsystems must include: \n \n \n(i) Documented policies and procedur es for the process of valuation. This \nincludes clearly defined responsibilities of the various areas involved in the \ndetermination of the valuation, sources of  market information and review of \ntheir appropriateness, guidelines for the use of unobservable inputs \nreflecting the bank\u2019s assumptions of what  market participants would use in \npricing the position, frequency of independent valuation, timing of closing prices, procedures for adjusting valua tions, end of the month and ad-hoc \nverification procedures; and \n \n(ii) Clear and independent (ie independent of front office) reporting lines for the \ndepartment accountable fo r the valuation process.  \n \n8.7.1.2   Valu ation methodologies \n \nMarking to market \n \n(i) Marking-to-market is at least the daily valuation of pos itions at readily \navailable close out prices in orderl y transactions that are sourced \nindependently. Examples of readily available close out prices include \nexchange prices, screen prices, or  quotes from several independent \nreputable brokers. \n \n(ii) Banks must mark-to-market as much as  possible. The more prudent side of \nbid/offer should be used unless the inst itution is a significant market maker \nin a particular position type and it  can close out at mid-market. Banks \nshould maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the \nuse of unobservable inputs when estimat ing fair value using a valuation \ntechnique. However, observable inputs or  transactions may not be relevant, \nsuch as in a forced liquidation or di stressed sale, or transactions may not \nbe observable, such as when markets are inactive. In such cases, the observable data should be considered , but may not be determinative. \n 87 \n Marking to model \n \niii)         Marking-to model is defined as any valuation which has to be benchmarked, \nextrapolated or otherwise calculated from a market input. Where marking-to-\nmarket is not possible, banks should follow the guidelines on valuation of \ninvestments contained in Master Circular DBOD No. BP. BC.3 / 21.04.141 / 2009-10 dated July 1, 2009 on prudential norms for classification, valuation and \noperation of investment portfolio by banks. For investment and derivative positions other than those covered in the Master Circular, the valuation model used by banks must be demonstrated to be prudent. When marking to \nvaluation model other than that prescribed in RBI/FIMMDA guidelines, an extra \ndegree of conservatism is appropriate. RBI will consider the following in assessing whether a mark-to-model valuation is prudent: \n \n\u2022 Senior management should be aware of the elements of the \ntrading book or of other fair-valued positions which are subject to mark to model and should  unde rstand the materiality of the \nuncertainty this creates in the reporting of the risk/performance \nof the business. \n \n\u2022 Market inputs should be sourced, to the extent possible, in \nline with market prices (as discussed above). The appropriateness of the market i nputs for the particular position \nbeing valued should be reviewed regularly. \n \n\u2022 Where available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products should be  used as far as possible. \n \n\u2022 Where the model is developed by the institution itself, it should be based on appropriate assumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties \nindependent of the development process. The model should be \ndeveloped or approved independent ly of the front office. It \nshould be independently tested. This includes validating the \nmathematics, the assumptions and the software \nimplementation. \n \n\u2022 There should be formal change control procedures in place \nand a secure copy of the model should be held and periodically \nused to check valuations. \n 88 \n \u2022 Risk management should be aw are of the weaknesses of the \nmodels used and how best to reflect those in the valuation \noutput. \n \n\u2022 The model should be subject to periodic review to determine \nthe accuracy of its performance (eg assessing continued appropriateness of the assumpti ons, analysis of P&L versus \nrisk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model \noutputs). \n \n\u2022 Valuation adjustments should  be made as appropriate, for \nexample, to cover the uncertainty of the model valuation (see \nalso valuation adjustments in paragraphs 8.7.1.2 (vi), (vii) and \n8.7.2.1 to 8.7.2.4.  \n \nIndependent price verification \n \niv)       Independent pri ce verification is distinct from  daily mark-to-market. It is \nthe process by which market pri ces or model inputs are regularly \nverified for accuracy. While daily ma rking-to-market may be performed \nby dealers, verification of market  prices or model inputs should be \nperformed by a unit independent of the dealing room, at least monthly \n(or, depending on the nature of th e market/trading activity, more \nfrequently). It need not be performed as frequently as daily mark-to-\nmarket, since the objective, i.e indepe ndent, marking of positions should \nreveal any error or bias in pricing, wh ich should result in  the elimination \nof inaccurate daily marks. \n \nv)       Independent pr ice verification entails a highe r standard of accuracy in \nthat the market prices or model input s are used to determine profit and \nloss figures, whereas daily marks are used primarily for management \nreporting in between reporting dates. For independent price verification, \nwhere pricing sources are more subject ive, eg only one available broker \nquote, prudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be \nappropriate. \n \nValuation adjustments  \n \nvi)      As part of their procedures for marking to market, banks must establish \nand maintain procedures for considering valuation adjustments. RBI \nwould particularly expect banks using third-party valuations to consider 89 \n whether valuation adjustments are ne cessary. Such considerations are \nalso necessary when marking to model. \n \nvii) At a minimum, banks should consider the following valuation \nadjustments while valuing th eir derivatives portfolios :  \n \n\u2022 unearned credit spreads,  \n\u2022 closeout costs,  \n\u2022 operational risks,  \n\u2022 early termination, investing and funding costs, and \n\u2022 future administrative costs and,  \n\u2022 where appropriate, model risk. \n \nBanks may follow any recognised me thod/model to compute the above \nadjustments. However, in the case of unear ned credit spread adjustments, if a \nbank does not have a model, it m ay follow the following norms:  \n \nDerivatives dealers generally use dynamic cr edit adjustments that reflect changes \nin the creditworthiness of their counterparties to the OTC derivatives portfolios. \nAdjustments for default risk are of two general kinds. The first includes \nallowances for anticipated credit losses, and the second includes the cost of \ncapital held to cover unant icipated credit losses.  \n \nUnearned credit spread adjustments are made to reflect the risk that the dealer \nwill not receive payments because of antici pated defaults by the counterparty. \nThese adjustments generally take into account netting arrangements and \ncollateral. Thus, adjustments that dealers act ually make for credit risk tend to be \nlower than adjustments that would be ma de if netting arrangements and collateral \nwere ignored.  In India, banks have not so far been permitted to have netting \nagreements in respect of derivatives transactions. Therefore, in cases where \nbanks do not have models to estimate adjustment for unearned credit spreads, \nthey may make provisions for expected losses by using CCF equal to 20% of the CCF used for computing the potential future exposure for the purpose of capital \nadequacy.   \n   \n \nIn addition to the cost of anticipate d credit losses, some dealers may make \nadjustments for a capital charge for bear ing the risk of unanticipated losses. Such \na charge would be reflected in the prices at which market participants are willing \nto enter into derivatives transactions. Th ese adjustments reflect the cost of the \nreturn that must be paid to capital held  to absorb the risk that credit losses will 90 \n exceed the highest anticipated level. Adjustments for the cost of unanticipated \nlosses are appropriate since the risk of such losses is inherent in a portfolio as of \nany valuation date. Banks need not make any adjustment for unanticipated losses \nas these are taken care of through credit conversion factors for potential future \nexposures while computing capital requirement as pe r extant instructions.  \n \nNote: Some of other terms used above are explained below:  \n \n Close-out costs  \n \nClose-out costs adjustment factors in the cost of eliminating the market risk of the portfolio. \n \nInvesting and Funding costs  \n \nThe \"investing and funding costs adjustment\" relati ng to the cost of funding and investing cash flow \nmismatches at rates different from the rate which models typically assume. \n \n \nAdministrative costs adjustment  \n \nAdministrative costs ad justment relates to the costs that will be incurred to administer the portfolio. \n \n \n8.7.2    Adjustment to the current  valuation of less                                                                \nliquid positions for re gulatory capital purposes \n \n8.7.2.1 Banks must establish and maintain  procedures for judging the necessity of \nand calculating an adjustment to the curr ent valuation of less liquid positions for \nregulatory capital purposes. This adjustment  may be in addition to any changes to \nthe value of the position required for fi nancial reporting purposes and should be \ndesigned to reflect the illiqui dity of the position. An adjustment to a position\u2019s \nvaluation to reflect current illiquidity shou ld be considered whether the position is \nmarked to market using market prices or  observable inputs, th ird-party valuations \nor marked to model. \n \n8.7.2.2 Bearing in mind that the assumptions  made about liquidity in the market \nrisk capital charge may not be consistent with the bank\u2019s ability  to sell or hedge \nout less liquid positions where appropriate, banks must take an adjustment to the \ncurrent valuation of these positions, and review their continued appropriateness \non an on-going basis. Reduced liquidity may have arisen from market events. 91 \n Additionally, close-out prices for concentr ated positions and/or stale positions \nshould be considered in establishing th e adjustment. RBI has not prescribed any \nparticularly methodology for calculating the amount of valuation adjustment on \naccount of illiquid positions . Banks must consider all relevant factors when \ndetermining the appropriateness of the adjustment for less liquid positions. These \nfactors may include, but are not limited to , the amount of time it would take to \nhedge out the position/risks within the positi on, the average volati lity of bid/offer \nspreads, the availability of independent market quotes (number and identity of \nmarket makers), the average and volatility  of trading volumes (including trading \nvolumes during periods of market stress) , market concentrations, the aging of \npositions, the extent to which valuation relies on marking-to-model, and the impact of other model risks not included in paragraph 8.7.2.2. The valuation \nadjustment on account of illiquidity should be considered irrespective of whether \nthe guidelines issued by FIMMDA have taken into account the illiquidity premium \nor not, while fixing YTM/spread s for the purpose of valuation. \n \n8.7.2.3 For complex products including,  but not limited to, securitisation \nexposures, banks must explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to \nreflect two forms of model risk:  \n(i) the model risk associated with us ing a possibly incorrect valuation \nmethodology; and the risk associated with using unobservable (and possibly \nincorrect) calibration paramete rs in the valuation model. \n \n8.7.2.4 The adjustment to the current valuation of less liquid positions made under paragraph 8.7.2.2 will not be debited to  P&L Account, but will be deducted from \nTier 1 regulatory capital while computi ng CRAR of the bank. The adjustment may \nexceed those valuation adjustments made  under financial reporting/accounting \nstandards and paragraphs 8.7.1.2 (vi) and (vii). \n \n8.7.2.5 In calculating the eligible capital for market ri sk, it will be necessary first to \ncalculate the banks\u2019 minimum capital requirem ent for credit and operational risk and only \nafterwards its market risk requirement to est ablish how much Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital is \navailable to support market risk. Eligible c apital will be the sum of the whole of banks\u2019 \nTier 1 capital plus all of Tier 2 capital provided Tier 2 capital does not exceed 100% of \nthe Tier 1 capital and the releva nt conditions for Tier 1 and Tier  2 capital are fulfilled, as \ndescribed in this Master Circular. \n \n 92 \n  \nComputation of capi tal for Market Ris k                                                         (in Rs. crore) \n1.

Capital Charge for Operational risk  \n9.1    Definition of operational risk \nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external ev ents. This definition includes legal risk, but \nexcludes strategic and reputational risk. Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to \nfines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting fr om supervisory actions, as well as private \nsettlements. 93 \n 9.2     The measurement methodologies \n9.2.1 The New Capital Adequacy Framework outlines three methods for calculating operational \nrisk capital charges in a continuum of increasing sophistication and risk sensitivity: (i) the Basic \nIndicator Approach (BIA); (ii) the Standardised Approach (TSA); and (iii) Advanced Measurement \nApproaches (AMA). \n9.2.2 Banks are encouraged to move along the spectrum of available approaches as they \ndevelop more sophisticated operational risk measurement systems and practices.  \n9.2.3 The New Capital Adequacy Framework provides that internationally active banks and \nbanks with significant operational risk exposures are expected to use an approach that is more \nsophisticated than the Basic Indicator Approach and that is appropriate for the risk profile of the \ninstitution. However, to begin with, banks in India shall compute the capital requirements for operational risk under the Basic Indicator Approach. Reserve Bank will review the capital \nrequirement produced by the Basic Indicator Approach for general credibility, especially in \nrelation to a bank\u2019s peers and in the event that credibility is lacking, appropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2 will be considered. \n9.3  The Basic Indicator Approach \n9.3.1 Under the Basic Indicator Approach, banks must hold capital for operational risk equal to \nthe average over the previous three years of a fixed percentage (denoted as alpha) of positive \nannual gross income. Figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative or zero \nshould be excluded from both the numerator and denominator when calculating the average. If negative gross income distorts a bank\u2019s Pillar 1 capital charge, Reserve Bank will consider \nappropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2. The charge may be expressed as follows: \nKBIA = [ \u2211 (GI 1\u2026n x \u03b1 \uf020)]/n \n       Where: \nKBIA =  the capital charge under the Basic Indicator Approach \nGI      =  annual gross income, where positive, over the previous three years \nn        =   number of the previous three years for which gross income is positive \n\u03b1        =  15 per cent, which is set by the BCBS , relating the industry wide level of \nrequired capital to the industry wide level of the indicator. \n9.3.2 Gross income is defined as \u201cNet interest income\u201d plus \u201cnet non-interest income\u201d. It is 94 \n intended that this measure should:  \ni) be gross of any provisions (e.g. for unpaid interest) and write-offs made during the \nyear;  \nii) be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service \nproviders, in addition to fees paid for services that are outsourced, fees received \nby banks that provide outsourcing services shall be included in the definition of \ngross income;   \niii) exclude reversal during the year in respect of provisions and write-offs made \nduring the previous year(s); \niv) exclude income recognised from the dis posal of items of movable and immovable \nproperty;  \nv)  exclude realised profits/losses from the sale of securities in the \u201cheld to maturity\u201d \ncategory ;  \nvi) exclude income from legal settlements in favour of the bank; \nvii)  exclude other extraordinary or irr egular items of income and expenditure; and \nviii) exclude income derived from insurance activities (i.e. income derived by writing \ninsurance policies) and insurance claims in favour of the bank.  \n \n9.3.3 Banks are advised to compute capital charge for operational risk under the Basic \nIndicator Approach as follows: \na) Average of [Gross Income * alpha] for each of the last three financial years, \nexcluding years of negative or zero gross income \nb) Gross income = Net profit (+) Provisions & contingencies   ( +) operating expenses \n(Schedule 16) (\u2013) items (iii) to (viii) of paragraph 9.3.2.  \nc) Alpha = 15 per cent \n \n9.3.4 As a point of entry for capital calculation, no specific criteria for use of the Basic Indicator Approach are set out in the New Capital Adequacy Framework. Nevertheless, banks using this approach are encouraged to comply with the Committee\u2019s guidance on Sound Practices for the \nManagement and Supervision of Operational Ris k, February 2003 and the Guidance Note on \nManagement of Operational Risk issued by the Reserve Bank of India in October 2005.  95 \n  \n      \n \nPart \u2013 B  : Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)  \n \n10. Introduction to the SREP under Pillar 2  \n \n10.1 The New Capital Adequacy Framework (NCAF), based on the Basel II Framework \nevolved by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, has been adapted for India vide our Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC 90/ 20.06.001/ 2006-07 dated April 27, 2007. In terms of paragraph \n2.4 (iii)(c) of the Annex to the aforesaid circular the banks were required to have a Board-\napproved policy on ICAAP and to asses the capita l requirement as per ICAAP. It is presumed \nthat the banks would have formulated the policy and also undertaken the capital adequacy assessment accordingly.  \n \n10.2 The Basel II Framework has three components or three Pillars. The Pillar 1 is the \nMinimum Capital Ratio while the Pillar 2 and Pillar 3 are the Supervisory Review Process (SRP) \nand Market Discipline, respectively.  While the guidelines on the Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 were issued by the RBI vide the aforesaid circular, since consolidated in this Master Circular in Part A and Part C, respectively, the guidelines in regard to the SRP and the Internal Capital Adequacy \nAssessment Process (ICAAP) are furnished at paragraph 11 below.  An illustrative outline of the \nformat of the ICAAP document, to be submitted to the RBI, by the banks, is furnished at Annex \u2013 15.  \n \n10.3 The objective of the SRP is to ensure that the banks have adequate capital to support all \nthe risks in their business as also to encour age them to develop and use better risk management \ntechniques for monitoring and managing their risks. This in turn would require a well-defined \ninternal assessment process within the banks through which they assure the RBI that adequate \ncapital is indeed held towards the various risks to which they are exposed. The process of assurance could also involve an active dialogue between the bank and the RBI so that, when warranted, appropriate intervention could be made to either reduce the risk exposure of the bank \nor augment / restore its capital. Thus, IC AAP is an important component of the SRP.  \n \n10.4 The main aspects to be addressed under the SRP, and therefore, under the ICAAP, \nwould include: \n  (a)  the risks that are not fully captured by the minimum capital ratio prescribed    \n                        under Pillar 1; 96 \n  \n(b)  the risks that are not at all taken into account by the Pillar 1; and  \n \n(c)  the factors external to the bank.  \nSince the capital adequacy ratio prescribed by the RBI under the Pillar 1 of the Framework is \nonly the regulatory minimum  level, addressing only the three specified risks (viz., credit, market \nand operational risks), holding additional capital might be necessary for the banks, on account of both \u2013 the possibility of some under-estimation of risks under the Pillar 1 and the actual risk \nexposure of a bank vis-\u00e0-vis the quality of its risk management architecture. Illustratively , some \nof the risks that the banks are generally exposed to but which are not captured or not fully \ncaptured in the regulatory CRAR would include:  \n(a)   Interest rate risk in the banking book;  \n(b)  Credit concentration risk;  \n(c)  Liquidity risk;  \n(d)  Settlement risk;  \n(e)  Reputational risk;  \n(f)  Strategic risk;  \n(g)  Risk of under-estimation of credit risk under the Standardised   \n           approach;  \n(h) \u201cModel risk\u201d i.e., the risk of under-estimation of credit risk under the IRB \napproaches;  \n \n(i) Risk of weakness in the credit-risk mitigants;  \n(j)  Residual risk of securitisation, etc.  \nIt is, therefore, only appropriate that the banks make their own assessment of their various risk \nexposures, through a well-defined internal process, and maintain an adequate capital cushion for such risks.  \n \n10.5 It is recognised that there is no one single approach for conducting the ICAAP and the market consensus in regard to the best practi ce for undertaking ICAAP is yet to emerge. The \nmethodologies and techniques are still evolving particularly in regard to measurement of non-\nquantifiable risks, such as reputational and strategic risks. These guidelines, therefore, seek to provide only broad principles to be followed by the banks in developing their ICAAP.  \n \n10.6 The banks were advised to develop and put in place, with the approval of their Boards, an \nICAAP commensurate with their size, level of complexity, risk profile and scope of operations. The ICAAP, which would be  in addition to a bank\u2019s calculation of regulatory capital requirements 97 \n under Pillar 1,  was to be operationalised with effect from March 31, 2008 by the foreign banks \nand the Indian banks with operational presence outside India, and from March 31, 2009 by all other commercial banks, excluding the Local Area Banks and Regional Rural banks. \n \n10.7 The ICAAP document should, inter alia , include the capital adequacy assessment and \nprojections of capital requirement for the ensuing year, along with the plans and strategies for \nmeeting the capital requirement. An illustrative  outline of a format of the ICAAP document is \nfurnished at Annex \u2013 15, for guidance of the banks though the ICAAP documents of the banks could vary in length and format, in tune with their size, level of complexity, risk profile and scope \nof operations.  \n \n11.  Need for improved risk management  \n11.1. While financial institutions have faced difficulties over the years for a \nmultitude of reasons, the major causes of  serious banking problems continue to \nbe lax credit standards for borrowers and counterparties, poor portfolio risk \nmanagement, and a lack of attention to changes in economic or other \ncircumstances that can lead to a deteriorat ion in the credit st anding of a bank's \ncounterparties. This experience is co mmon in both advanced and developing \ncountries. \n \n11.2. The financial market crisis of  2007-08 has underscored the critical \nimportance of effective credit risk mana gement to the long-term success of any \nbanking organisation and as a key component to financial stability. It has provided \na stark reminder of the need for banks to  effectively identify, measure, monitor \nand control credit risk, as well as to u nderstand how credit risk interacts with \nother types of risk (includi ng market, liquidity and reput ational risk). The essential \nelements of a comprehensive credit risk management programme include (i) \nestablishing an appropriate credit risk environment; (ii) operating under a sound \ncredit granting process; (iii) maintaining an appropriate credit administration, \nmeasurement and monitoring process; and (i v) ensuring adequate controls over \ncredit risk as elaborated in our Guid ance note on Credit Risk issued on October \n12, 2002. \n \n11.3. The recent crisis has emphasised the importance of effective capital \nplanning and longer-term capital maintena nce. A bank\u2019s ability to withstand \nuncertain market conditions is bolstered by maintaining a strong capital position \nthat accounts for potential changes in the bank\u2019s strategy and volatility in market \nconditions over time. Banks should focu s on effective and efficient capital \nplanning, as well as long-term capital main tenance. An effecti ve capital planning 98 \n process requires a bank to assess both the risks to which it is exposed and the \nrisk management processes in place to mana ge and mitigate those risks; evaluate \nits capital adequacy relative to its risks;  and consider the potential impact on \nearnings and capital from economic downtur ns. A bank\u2019s capital planning process \nshould incorporate rigorous, forwardlooki ng stress testing, as discussed below in \nPara 12.9. \n \n11.4 Rapid growth in any business activity can present banks with significant risk \nmanagement challenges. This was th e case with the expanded use of the \n\u201coriginate-to-distribute\u201d business model, off-balance sheet vehicles, liquidity \nfacilities and credit derivatives. The  originate-to-distribute model and \nsecuritisation can enhance credit intermedia tion and bank profitability, as well as \nmore widely diversify risk. Managing  the associated risks, however, poses \nsignificant challenges. Indeed, these activ ities create exposures within business \nlines, across the firm and across risk factor s that can be difficult to identify, \nmeasure, manage, mitigate and control. This is especially true in an environment \nof declining market liquidity, asset prices and risk appetite. The inability to \nproperly identify and measure such risks may lead to unintended risk exposures \nand concentrations, which in turn can lead  to concurrent losses arising in several \nbusinesses and risk dimensions due to a common set of factors. Strong demand \nfor structured products created incentives for banks using the originate-to-\ndistribute model to originate loans, such  as subprime mortgages, using unsound \nand unsafe underwriting standards. At the same time, many investors relied solely \non the ratings of the credit rating agencies (CRAs) when determining whether to invest in structured credit products. Many investors conducted little or no \nindependent due diligence on the st ructured products they purchased. \nFurthermore, many banks had insufficient risk management processes in place to address the risks associated with exposures held on their balance sheet, as well as those associated with off-balance sheet  entities, such as asset backed \ncommercial paper (ABCP) conduits and st ructured investment vehicles (SIVs). \n \n11.5 Innovation has increased the complexity and potential illiquidity of structured \ncredit products. This, in turn, can make su ch products more diffi cult to value and \nhedge, and may lead to inadvertent in creases in overall risk. Further, the \nincreased growth of complex investor-specifi c products may result in thin markets \nthat are illiquid, which can expose a bank to large losses in times of stress if the \nassociated risks are not well understood a nd managed in a timely and effective \nmanner. \n \n \n12 Guidelines for the SREP of the RBI and the ICAAP of the banks  \n \n12.1 The Background \n12.1.1 While the Basel - I framework was confined to the prescription of only minimum capital 99 \n requirements for banks, the Basel II framework expands this approach not only to capture certain \nadditional risks in the minimum capital ratio but also includes two additional areas, namely, the Supervisory Review Process and Market Discipline through increased disclosure requirements \nfor banks. Thus, the Basel II framework rests on the following three mutually- reinforcing pillars: \nPillar 1 : Minimum Capital Requirements \u2014 which prescribes a risk-sensitive calculation of \ncapital requirements that, for the first time, explicitly includes operational risk in addition \nto market and credit risk. \n \nPillar 2 : Supervisory Review Process (SRP) \u2014 which envisages the establishment of \nsuitable risk management systems in banks and thei r review by the supervisory authority. \n \nPillar 3 : Market Discipline \u2014 which seeks to achieve increased transparency through \nexpanded disclosure requirements for banks. \n  \n12.1.2. The Basel II document of the Basel Committee also lays down the following four key \nprinciples in regard to the SRP envisaged under Pillar 2:  \nPrinciple 1 :  Banks should have a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy \nin relation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels. \nPrinciple 2 :  Supervisors should review and evaluate  the banks\u2019 internal capital \nadequacy assessments and strategies, as well as their ability to monitor and ensure their \ncompliance with the regulatory capital ratios. Supervisors should take appropriate \nsupervisory action if they are not satisfied with the result of this process.   \nPrinciple 3 :  Supervisors should expect banks to operate above the minimum regulatory \ncapital ratios and should have the ability to require the banks to hold capital in excess of \nthe minimum.  \nPrinciple 4 :  Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital \nfrom falling below the minimum levels required to support the risk characteristics of a \nparticular bank and should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or \nrestored. \n12.1.3 It would be seen that the principles 1 and 3 relate to the supervisory expectations from \nthe banks while the principles 2 and 4 deal with the role of the supervisors under Pillar 2. The Pillar 2 (Supervisory Review Process - SRP) requires banks to implement an internal process, \ncalled the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP), for assessing their capital \nadequacy in relation to their risk profiles as well as a strategy for maintaining their capital levels. The Pillar 2 also requires the supervisory authorities to subject all banks to an evaluation process, hereafter called Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), and to initiate such supervisory measures on that basis, as might be considered necessary. An analysis of the \nforegoing principles indicates that the following broad responsibilities have been cast on the \nbanks and the supervisors:  100 \n Banks\u2019 responsibilities  \n \na) Banks should have in place a process for assessing their overall capital adequacy \nin relation to their risk profile and a strategy for maintaining their capital levels \n(Principle 1) \n \nb) Banks should operate above the minimum regulatory capital ratios (Principle 3) \nSupervisors\u2019 responsibilities  \na) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank\u2019s ICAAP. (Principle 2) \nb) Supervisors should take appropriate action if they are not satisfied with the results \nof this process. (Principle 2) \nc) Supervisors should review and evaluate a bank\u2019s compliance with the regulatory \ncapital ratios. (Principle 2) \nd) Supervisors should have the ability to require banks to hold capital in excess of \nthe minimum. (Principle 3) \ne) Supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital from \nfalling below the minimum levels. (Principle 4) \nf) Supervisors should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or \nrestored. (Principle 4) \n12.1.4  Thus, the ICAAP and SREP are the two important components of Pillar 2 and \ncould be broadly defined as follows:   \nThe ICAAP comprises a bank\u2019s procedures and measures designed to ensure the \nfollowing:  \na) An appropriate identification and measurement of risks; \nb) An appropriate level of internal capital in relation to the bank\u2019s risk profile; and \nc) Application and further development of suitable risk management systems in the \nbank. \n \nThe SREP consists of a review and evaluation process adopted by the supervisor, which \ncovers all the processes and measures defined in the principles listed above. Essentially, these \ninclude the review and evaluation of the bank\u2019s ICAAP, conducting an independent assessment \nof the bank\u2019s risk profile, and if necessary, taking appropriate prudential measures and other supervisory actions. \n \n12.1.5  These guidelines seek to provide broad guidance to the banks by outlining the \nmanner in which the SREP would be carried out by the RBI, the expected scope and design of \ntheir ICAAP, and the expectations of the RBI from the banks in regard to implementation of the \nICAAP. \n  101 \n 12.2 Conduct of the SREP by the RBI \n12.2.1  Capital helps protect individual banks from insolvency, thereby promoting safety \nand soundness in the overall banking system. Minimum regulatory capital requirements under \nPillar 1 establish a threshold below which a sound bank\u2019s regulatory capital must not fall. \nRegulatory capital ratios permit some comparative analysis of capital adequacy across regulated banking entities because they are based on certain common methodology / assumptions. \nHowever, supervisors need to perform a more comprehensive assessment of capital adequacy \nthat considers risks specific to a bank, conducting analyses that go beyond minimum regulatory \ncapital requirements. \n \n12.2.2  The RBI generally expects banks to hold capital above their minimum regulatory \ncapital levels, commensurate with their individual ri sk profiles, to account for all material risks. \nUnder the SREP, the RBI will assess the overall capital adequacy of a bank through a \ncomprehensive evaluation that takes into account all relevant available information. In \ndetermining the extent to which banks should hold capital in excess of the regulatory minimum, \nthe RBI would take into account the combined implications of a bank\u2019s compliance with regulatory minimum capital requirements, the quality and results of a bank\u2019s ICAAP, and \nsupervisory assessment of the bank\u2019s risk m anagement processes, control systems and other \nrelevant information relating to the bank\u2019s risk profile and capital position.  \n \n12.2.3  The SREP of the banks would, thus, be conducted by the RBI periodically, \ngenerally, along with the RBI\u2019s Annual Financial Inspection (AFI) of the banks and in the light of \nthe data in the off-site returns received from the banks in the RBI, in conjunction with the ICAAP document, which is required to be submitted every year by the banks to the RBI (Cf. Para 11.3.4 \nbelow). Through the SREP, the RBI would evaluate the adequacy and efficacy of the ICAAP of \nthe banks and the capital requirements derived by them therefrom. While in the course of \nevaluation, there would be no attempt to reconcile the difference between the regulatory minimum CRAR and the outcome of the ICAAP of a bank (as the risks covered under the two processes are different), the banks would be expected to demonstrate to the RBI that the ICAAP adopted by them is fully responsive to their size, level of complexity, scope & scale of operations \nand the resultant risk profile / exposures, and adequately captures their capital requirements. \nSuch an evaluation of the effectiveness of the ICAAP would help the RBI in understanding the \ncapital management processes and strategies adopted by the banks. If considered necessary, the SREP could also involve a dialogue between the bank\u2019s top management and the RBI from 102 \n time to time. In addition to the periodic reviews, independent external experts may also be \ncommissioned by the RBI, if deemed necessary, to perform ad hoc reviews and comment on \nspecific aspects of the ICAAP process of a bank; the nature and extent of such a review shall be \ndetermined by the RBI.   \n \n12.2.4  Under the SREP, the RBI would also seek to determine whether a bank\u2019s overall \ncapital remains adequate as the underlying conditions change. Generally, material increases in risk that are not otherwise mitigated should be accompanied by commensurate increases in \ncapital. Conversely, reductions in overall capital (to a level still above regulatory minima) may be \nappropriate if the RBI\u2019s supervisory assessment leads it to a conclusion that risk has materially \ndeclined or that it has been appropriately mitigated. Based on such an assessment, the RBI could consider initiating appropriate supervisory  measures to address its supervisory concerns. \nThe measures could include requiring a modification or enhancement of the risk management and internal control processes of a bank, a reduction in risk exposures, or any other action as \ndeemed necessary to address the identified supervi sory concerns. These measures could also \ninclude the stipulation of a bank-specific minimu m CRAR that could potentially be even higher, if \nso warranted by the facts and circumstances, than the regulatory minimum stipulated under the \nPillar 1.  In cases where the RBI decides to stipulate a CRAR at a level higher than the regulatory minimum, it would explain the rationale for doing so, to the bank concerned. However, \nsuch an add-on CRAR stipulation, though possible, is not expected to be an automatic or \ninevitable outcome of the SREP exercise, the prime objective being improvement in the risk management systems of the banks.  \n  \n12.2.5  As and when the advanced approaches envisaged in the Basel II document are \npermitted to be adopted in India, the SREP would also assess the ongoing compliance by the \nbanks with the eligibility criteria for adopting the advanced approaches.  \n \n12.3 The structural aspects of the ICAAP \n12.3.1 This section outlines the broad parameters of the ICAAP that the banks are required to \ncomply with in designing and implementing their ICAAP. \n \n12.3.2   Every bank to have an ICAAP\nReckoning that the Basel II framework is applicable to all commercial banks (except the Local Area Banks and the Regional Rural Banks), both at the solo level (global position) as well as at 103 \n the consolidated level, the ICAAP should be prepared, on a solo basis, at every tier for each \nbanking entity within the banking group, as also at the level of the consolidated bank (i.e., a group of entities where the licensed bank is the controlling entity). This requirement would also \napply to the foreign banks which have a branch presence in India and their ICAAP should cover \ntheir Indian operations only.  \n \n12.3.3 ICAAP to encompass firm-wide risk profile  \n12.3.3.1  General firm-wide risk management principles \nSenior management should understand th e importance of taking an integrated, \nfirm-wide perspective of a bank\u2019s risk ex posure, in order to support its ability to \nidentify and react to emerging and growing risks in a timely and effective manner. \nThe purpose of this guidance is the need to enhance firm-wide oversight, risk \nmanagement and controls around banks\u2019 capital markets activities, including securitisation, off-balance sheet exposures, structured credit and complex trading activities. \n \nA sound risk management system shoul d have the following key features: \n \n\u2022    Active board and senior management oversight; \n \n\u2022    Appropriate polici es, procedures and limits; \n \n\u2022 Comprehensive and timely identifi cation, measurement , mitigation,  \ncontrolling, monitoring and reporting of risks; \n \n\u2022   Appropriate management information systems (MIS) at the business and \nfirm-wide level; and \n \n\u2022  Comprehensive internal controls. \n \n \n12.3.3.2   ICAAP to be a Board -approved process  Board and Senior Managemen t \nOversight  \n \nThe ultimate responsibility for designing an d implementation of the ICAAP lies with the \nbank\u2019s board of directors of the bank and with the Chief Execut ive Officer in the case of 104 \n the foreign banks with branch presence in India . It is the responsibility of the board of \ndirectors and senior management to define the institution\u2019s risk appetite and to \nensure that the bank\u2019s risk management framework includes detailed policies that \nset specific firm-wide prude ntial limits on the bank\u2019s activities, which are \nconsistent with its risk taking appetite and capacity. In order to determine the \noverall risk appetite, the board and se nior management must first have an \nunderstanding of risk exposures on a firm-wide basis. To achieve this \nunderstanding, the appropriate member s of senior management must bring \ntogether the perspectives of the key busi ness and control functions. In order to \ndevelop an integrated firm-wide perspe ctive on risk, senior management must \novercome organisational silos between  business lines and share information on \nmarket developments, risks and risk miti gation techniques. As the banking \nindustry is exhibiting the tendency to move increasingly towards market-based intermediation, there is a greater probabili ty that many areas of a bank may be \nexposed to a common set of products, ri sk factors or counterparties. Senior \nmanagement should establish a risk manage ment process that is not limited to \ncredit, market, liquidity and operational ri sks, but incorporates all material risks. \nThis includes reputational, legal and strate gic risks, as well as risks that do not \nappear to be significant in isolation, but when combined with other risks could \nlead to material losses. \n \nThe board of directors and senior management should possess sufficient \nknowledge of all major business lines to ensu re that appropriate policies, controls \nand risk monitoring systems are effect ive. They should have the necessary \nexpertise to understand the capital market s activities in which the bank is \ninvolved \u2013 such as securitisation and off-balance sheet activities \u2013 and the associated risks. The board and senior management should remain informed on an on-going basis about these risks as financial markets, risk management \npractices and the bank\u2019s activities evolve.  In addition, the board and senior \nmanagement should ensure that accountab ility and lines of authority are clearly \ndelineated. With respect to new or co mplex products and activities, senior \nmanagement should understand the underlying assumptions regarding business \nmodels, valuation and risk management practices. In addition, senior management should evaluate the potential risk exposur e if those assumptions fail.  Before \nembarking on new activities or introducing products new to the institution, the \nboard and senior management should identify and review the changes in firm-\nwide risks arising from these potential new pr oducts or activities and ensure that \nthe infrastructure and internal controls necessary to manage the related risks are in place. In this review, a bank should al so consider the possible difficulty in \nvaluing the new products a nd how they might perform in a stressed economic \nenvironment. The Board should ensure that  the senior management of the bank : \ni.    establishes a risk framework in order to assess and appropriately manage \nthe various risk exposures of the bank; \nii.    develops a system to monitor the bank's risk exposures and to relate them to the bank's capital and reserve funds; 105 \n iii.    establishes a method to monitor the bank's compliance with internal \npolicies, particularly in regard to risk management; and \niv.    effectively communicates all relevant policies and procedures throughout \nthe bank. \n A bank\u2019s risk function and its chief ri sk officer (CRO) or equivalent position \nshould be independent of the individual business lines a nd report directly to the \nchief executive officer (CEO)/ Managing Director  and the institution\u2019s board of \ndirectors. In addition, th e risk function should highlight  to senior management and \nthe board risk management concerns, such  as risk concentrations and violations \nof risk appetite limits. \n \n12.3.3.4  Policies, proce dures, limits and controls \n \nThe structure, design and contents of a bank's ICAAP should be approved by the \nboard of directors to ensure that the ICAAP forms an integral part of the \nmanagement process and decision making culture of the bank. Firm-wide risk \nmanagement programmes should include detailed policies that set specific firm-\nwide prudential limits on the principal risks relevant to a bank\u2019s activities. A bank\u2019s policies and procedures should provide specific guidance for the implementation of broad business stra tegies and should establish, where \nappropriate, internal limits for the various types of risk to which the bank may be \nexposed. These limits should consider the ba nk\u2019s role in the financial system and \nbe defined in relation to the bank\u2019s capital, total assets, earnings or, where \nadequate measures exist, its overall risk level. \n \nA bank\u2019s policies, procedures and limits should: \n \n\u2022 Provide for adequate and timely identification, measurement, monitoring, \ncontrol and mitigation of the risks posed by its lending, investing, trading, securitisation, offbalance sheet, fiduciary and other significant \nactivities at the business lin e and firm-wide levels; \n \n\u2022 Ensure that the economic substance of a bank\u2019s risk exposures, \nincluding reputational risk and va luation uncertainty, are fully \nrecognised and incorporated into  the bank\u2019s risk management \nprocesses; \n \n\u2022 Be consistent with the bank\u2019s stated goals and objectives, as well as its overall financial strength; \n 106 \n \u2022 Clearly delineate accountability and lines of authority across the bank\u2019s \nvarious business activities, and ensu re there is a clear separation \nbetween business lines and the risk function; \n \n\u2022 Escalate and address breaches of  internal position limits; \n \n\u2022 Provide for the review of new businesses and products by bringing together all relevant risk manageme nt, control and business lines to \nensure that the bank is able to manage and control the activity prior to it \nbeing initiated; and \n \n\u2022 Include a schedule and process for r eviewing the policies, procedures \nand limits and for updating them as appropriate. \n \n12.3.3.5  Identifying, measuring,  monitoring and reporting of risk \n  \nA bank\u2019s MIS should provide the board a nd senior management in a clear and \nconcise manner with timely and relevant in formation concerning their institutions\u2019 \nrisk profile. This information should incl ude all risk exposures, including those \nthat are off-balance sheet. Manageme nt should understand the assumptions \nbehind and limitations inherent  in specific risk measures. \n \nThe key elements necessary for the aggregation of risks are an appropriate \ninfrastructure and MIS that (i) allow for the aggregati on of exposures and risk \nmeasures across business lines and (ii) support customised identification of \nconcentrations and emerging risks. MIS developed to achieve this objective \nshould support the ability to evaluate the im pact of various types of economic and \nfinancial shocks that affect the whole of the financial institution. Further, a bank\u2019s \nsystems should be flexible enough to in corporate hedging and other risk \nmitigation actions to be carried out on a firm-wide basis while taking into account \nthe various related basis risks. \n \nTo enable proactive management of risk, the board and senior management need \nto ensure that MIS is capable of provid ing regular, accurate and timely information \non the bank\u2019s aggregate risk profile, as well as the main assumptions used for risk \naggregation. MIS should be adaptable and responsive to changes in the bank\u2019s \nunderlying risk assumptions and should incor porate multiple perspectives of risk \nexposure to account for uncertainties in ri sk measurement. In addition, it should \nbe sufficiently flexible so that the institution can generate forward-looking bank-\nwide scenario analyses that capture management\u2019s interpretation of evolving \nmarket conditions and stressed conditions. Third-party inputs or other tools used within MIS (eg credit ratings, risk measures,  models) should be subject to initial 107 \n and ongoing validation. \n \nA bank\u2019s MIS should be capable of capturing limit breaches and there should be \nprocedures in place to promptly report such breaches to senior management, as \nwell as to ensure that appropriate fo llow-up actions are taken. For instance, \nsimilar exposures should be aggregated across business platforms (including the \nbanking and trading books) to determine whether there is a concentration or a \nbreach of an internal position limit. \n \n12.3.3.6 Internal controls \n \nRisk management processes should be fr equently monitored and tested by \nindependent control areas and internal, as we ll as external, auditors. The aim is to \nensure that the information on which deci sions are based is accurate so that \nprocesses fully reflect management polici es and that regular reporting, including \nthe reporting of limit breaches and other exception-based reporting, is undertaken \neffectively. The risk management function of banks must be independent of the \nbusiness lines in order to ensure an adequate separation of duties and to avoid \nconflicts of interest. \n \nSince a sound risk management process provides the basis for ensuring that a bank \nmaintains adequate capital, the board of directors of a bank shall set the tolerance level for risk. \n The structure, design and contents of a bank\u2019s ICAAP should be approved by the board \nof directors t o ensure that the ICAAP forms an integral part of the management process \nand decision making culture of the bank. Since a sound risk management process \nprovides the basis for ensuring that a bank maintains adequate capital, the board of \ndirectors of a bank  shall:  \n \na) set the tolerance level for risk;  \nb) ensure that the senior ma nagement of the bank:  \ni. establishes a risk framework in order to assess and appropriately \nmanage the various risk exposures of the bank;  \nii. develops a system to monito r the bank\u2019s risk exposure s and to \nrelate them to the bank\u2019s capital and reserve funds;  \niii. establishes a method to monitor the bank\u2019s compliance with \ninternal policies, particularly in regard to risk management;  \niv. effectively communicates all rele vant policies and procedures \nthroughout the bank;  108 \n c) adopt and support strong internal controls;  \nd) ensure that the bank has appropriate written policies and procedures in \nplace;  \ne) ensure that the bank has an appropriate strategic plan in place, which, as a \nminimum , shall duly outline  \nf) the bank\u2019s current  and future capital needs;  \ng) the bank\u2019s anticipated capital expenditure; and  \nh) the bank\u2019s desired level of capital.  \n \n12.3.3.7 Submission of the outcome of the ICAAP to the Board and the RBI  \n \nAs the ICAAP is an ongoing process, a written re cord on the outcome of the ICAAP should to be \nperiodically submitted by the banks to their board of directors. Such written record of the internal \nassessment of its capital adequacy should include, inter alia , the risks identified, the manner in \nwhich those risks are monitored and managed, the impact of the bank\u2019s changing risk profile on \nthe bank\u2019s capital position, details of stress tests/scenario analysis conducted and the resultant \ncapital requirements. The reports sh all be sufficiently detailed to allow the Board of Directors to \nevaluate the level and trend of material risk exposures, whether the bank maintains adequate \ncapital against the risk exposures and in case  of additional capital being needed, the plan for \naugmenting capital. The board of directors would be expected make timely adjustments to the strategic plan, as necessary. \n \nBased on the outcome of the ICAAP as submi tted to and approved by the Board, the ICAAP \nDocument, in the format furnished at Annex 15, should be furnished to the RBI (i.e., to the CGM-\nin-Charge, Department of Banking Supervision, C entral Office, Reserve Bank of India, World \nTrade Centre, Centre I, Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Mumbai \u2013 400 005).  The document should reach \nthe RBI latest by end of the first quarter (i.e April-June) of the relevant financial year.  \n \n12.4 Review of the ICAAP outcomes \n \nThe board of directors shall, at least once a year, assess and document whether the processes \nrelating the ICAAP implemented by the bank su ccessfully achieve the objectives envisaged by \nthe board. The senior management should also receive and review the reports regularly to \nevaluate the sensitivity of the key assumptions and to assess the validity of the bank\u2019s estimated future capital requirements. In the light of such an assessment, appropriate changes in the \nICAAP should be instituted to ensure that the underlying objectives are effectively achieved.  109 \n  \n \n12.5       ICAAP to be an Integral part of the management and decision-making culture  \n \nThe ICAAP should from an integral part of the management and decision-making culture of a \nbank. This integration could range from using the ICAAP to internally allocate capital to various \nbusiness units, to having it play a role in the individual credit decision process and pricing of products or more general business decisions such as expansion plans and budgets. The integration would also mean that ICAAP should enable the bank management to assess, on an \nongoing basis, the risks that are inherent in their activities and material to the institution. \n \n12.6      The Principle of proportionality  \n \nThe implementation of ICAAP should be guided by the principle of proportionality.  Though the \nbanks are encouraged to migrate to and adopt progressively sophisticated approaches in \ndesigning their ICAAP, the RBI would expect the degree of sophistication adopted in the ICAAP \nin regard to risk measurement and management to be commensurate with the nature, scope, scale and the degree of complexity in the bank\u2019s business operations. The following paragraphs \nillustratively  enumerate the broad approach which could be considered by the banks with \nvarying levels of complexity in their operations, in formulating their ICAAP.  \n \n(A)  In relation to a bank that defines its activities and risk management practices as \nsimple, in carrying out its ICAAP, that bank could: \n \na) identify and consider that bank\u2019s  largest losses over the last 3 to 5 years and \nwhether those losses are likely to recur; \n \nb) prepare a short list of the most signific ant risks to which that bank is exposed; \n \nc) consider how that bank  would act, and the amount of capital that would be absorbed \nin the event that each of the risks identified were to materialise; \n \nd) consider how that bank\u2019s  capital requirement  might alter under the scenarios in (c) \nand how its capital requirement  might alter in line with its business plans for the next \n3 to 5 years; and \n \ne) document the ranges of capital required in the scenarios identified above and form \nan overall view on the amount and quality of capital which that bank  should hold, \nensuring that its senior management is involved in arriving at that view. \n \n(B)  In relation to a bank that define its activities and risk management practices as \nmoderately complex, in carrying out its ICAAP, that bank could: \n 110 \n a) having consulted the operational management in each major business line, prepare \na comprehensive list of the major risks to which the business is exposed; \nb) estimate, with the aid of historical data, where available, the range and distribution \nof possible losses which might arise from each of those risks and consider using \nshock stress tests to provide risk estimates; \nc) consider the extent to which that bank\u2019s capital requirement  adequately captures the \nrisks identified in (a) and (b) above; \nd) for areas in which the capital requirement  is either inadequate or does not address a \nrisk, estimate the additional capital needed to protect that bank and its customers, in \naddition to any other risk mitigation action that bank  plans to take; \ne) consider the risk that the bank\u2019s  own analyses of capital adequacy may be \ninaccurate and that it may suffer from management weaknesses which affect the \neffectiveness of its risk management and mitigation; \nf) project that bank\u2019s  business activities forward in detail for one year and in less detail \nfor the next 3 to 5 years, and estimate how that bank\u2019s capital and capital requirement  would alter, assuming that business develops as expected; \ng) assume that business does not develop as expected and consider how that  bank\u2019s \ncapital and capital requirement  would alter and what that bank\u2019s  reaction to a range \nof adverse economic scenarios might be; \nh) document the results obtained from the analyses in (b), (d), (f), and (g) above in a \ndetailed report for that bank\u2019s  top management / board of directors; and \ni) ensure that systems and processes are in place to review the accuracy of the \nestimates made in (b), (d), (f) and (g) (i.e., systems for back testing) vis-\u00e0-vis the performance / actuals. \n \n(C) In relation to a bank that define its activities and risk management practices as complex, \nin carrying out its ICAAP, that bank could follow a proportional approach to that bank\u2019s ICAAP  \nwhich should cover the issues identified at (a) to (d ) in paragraph (B) above, but is likely also to \ninvolve the use of models, most of which will be integrated into its day-to-day management and \noperations. \n \nModels of the kind referred to above may be linked so as to generate an overall estimate of the amount of capital that a bank  considers appropriate to hold for its business needs. A bank  may \nalso link such models to generate information on the economic capital considered desirable for \nthat bank. A model which a bank  uses to generate its target amount of economic capital is \nknown as an economic capital model (ECM).  Ec onomic capital is the target amount of capital \nwhich optimises the return for a bank\u2019s  stakeholders for a desired level of risk. For example, a \nbank  is likely to use value-at-risk (VaR) models for  market risk, advanced modelling approaches \nfor credit risk and, possibly, advanced measurement approaches for operational risk. A bank  \nmight also use economic scenario generators to model stochastically its business forecasts and 111 \n risks. However, the advanced approaches envisaged in the Basel II Framework are not currently \npermitted by the RBI and the banks would need prior approval of the RBI  for migrating to the \nadvanced approaches. \n \nSuch a bank is also likely to be part of a group  and to be operating internationally. There is likely \nto be centralised control over the models used throughout the  group, the assumptions made and \ntheir overall calibration. \n \n12.7       Regular independent review and validation\n \nThe ICAAP should be subject to regular and independent review through an internal or external \naudit process, separately from the SREP conducted by the RBI, to ensure that the ICAAP is comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scope, scale and level of complexity of the \nbank\u2019s activities so that it accurately reflects the major sources of risk that the bank is exposed \nto.  A bank shall ensure appropriate and effective inte rnal control structures, particularly in regard \nto the risk management processes, in order to  monitor the bank\u2019s continued compliance with \ninternal policies and procedures. As a minimum, a bank shall conduct periodic reviews of its risk management processes, which should ensure: \na) the integrity, accuracy, and reasonableness of the processes; \n \nb) the appropriateness of the bank\u2019s capital assessment process based on the \nnature, scope, scale and complexity of the bank\u2019s activities; \n \nc) the timely identification of any concentration risk; \n \nd) the accuracy and completeness of any data inputs into the bank\u2019s capital \nassessment process; \n \ne) the reasonableness and validity of any assumptions and scenarios used in the \ncapital assessment process; \n \nf) that the bank conducts appropriate stress testing; \n \n12.8       ICAAP to be a forward-looking process  \n \nThe ICAAP should be forward looking in nature, and thus, should take into account the expected \n/ estimated future developments such as strategic plans, macro economic factors, etc., including \nthe likely future constraints in the availability and use of capital. As a minimum, the management \nof a bank shall develop and maintain an appropriate strategy that would ensure that the bank \nmaintains adequate capital commensurate with the nature, scope, scale, complexity and risks \ninherent in the bank\u2019s on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activities, and should demonstrate \nas to how the strategy dovetails with the macro-economic factors. 112 \n  \nThus, the banks shall have an explicit, Board-approved capital plan which should spell out the \ninstitution's objectives in regard to level of capital, the time horizon for achieving those objectives, and in broad terms, the capital planning process and the allocate responsibilities for \nthat process. The plan shall outline: \n \na) the bank\u2019s capital needs; \n \nb) the bank\u2019s anticipated capital utilisation; \n \nc) the bank\u2019s desired level of capital; \n \nd) limits related to capital; \n \ne) a general contingency plan for dealing with divergences and unexpected events. \n \n12.9        ICAAP to be a risk-based process  \n \nThe adequacy of a bank\u2019s capital is a function of its risk profile.  Banks shall, therefore, set their \ncapital targets which are consistent with their risk profile and operating environment. As a \nminimum, a bank shall have in place a sound ICAAP, which shall include all material risk \nexposures incurred by the bank. There are some types of risks (such as reputation risk and \nstrategic risk) which are less readily quantifiable; for such risks, the focus of the ICAAP should be \nmore on qualitative assessment, risk management and mitigation than on quantification of such \nrisks.  Banks\u2019 ICAAP document shall clearly indicate for which risks a quantitative measure is \nconsidered warranted, and for which risks a qualitative measure is considered to be the correct approach. \n \n \n12.10        ICAAP to include stress tests and scenario analyses  \n \nAs part of the ICAAP, the management of a bank shall, as a minimum, conduct relevant stress \ntests periodically, particularly in respect of the bank\u2019s material risk exposures, in order to evaluate the potential vulnerability of the bank to some unlikely but plausible events or \nmovements in the market conditions that could have an adverse impact on the bank. The use of \nstress testing framework can provide a bank\u2019s management a better understanding of the bank\u2019s  \nlikely exposure in extreme circumstances. In this c ontext, the attention is also invited to the RBI \ncircular DBOD.No.BP.BC.101/21.04.103/2006-07 dated June 26, 2007 on stress testing wherein \nthe banks were advised to put in place appropriate stress testing policies and stress test \nframeworks, incorporating \u201csensitivity tests\u201d and \u201c scenario tests\u201d, for the various risk factors, by \nSeptember 30, 2007, on a trial / pilot basis and to operationalise formal stress testing \nframeworks from March 31, 2008. The banks are urged to take necessary measures for 113 \n implementing an appropriate formal stress testin g framework by the date specified which would \nalso meet the stress testing requirements under the ICAAP of the banks.  \n \n12.11 Use of capital models for ICAAP  \n \nWhile the RBI does not expect the banks to use complex and sophisticated econometric models \nfor internal assessment of their capital require ments, and there is no RBI-mandated requirement \nfor adopting such models, the banks, with international presence, were required, in terms of \nparagraph 17 of our Circular DBOD.No.BP(SC).BC98/21.04.103/99 dated October 7, 1999, to develop suitable methodologies, by March 31, 2001, for estimating and maintaining economic \ncapital.  However, some of the banks, which have relatively complex operations and are \nadequately equipped in this regard, may like to place reliance on such models as part of their ICAAP.  While there is no single prescribed approach as to how a bank should develop its capital model, a bank adopting a model-based approach to its ICAAP shall be able to, inter alia,  \ndemonstrate: \na) Well documented model specifications, including the methodology / mechanics \nand the assumptions underpinning the working of the model; \n \nb) The extent of reliance on the historical  data in the model and the system of back \ntesting to be carried out to assess the validity of the outputs of the model vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe actual outcomes; \n \nc) A robust system for independent validation of the model inputs and outputs; \n \nd) A system of stress testing the model to establish that the model remains valid \neven under extreme conditions / assumptions; \n \ne) The level of confidence assigned to the model outputs and its linkage to the \nbank\u2019s business strategy; \n \nf) The adequacy of the requisite skills and resources within the banks to operate, \nmaintain and develop the model. \n \n13 Select operational aspects of the ICAAP \n This Section outlines in somewhat greater detail the scope of the risk universe expected \nto be normally captured by the banks in their ICAAP. \n13.1     Identifying and measuring material risks in ICAAP  \nThe first objective of an ICAAP is to identify all material risks. Risks that can be reliably \nmeasured and quantified should be treated as rigorously as data and methods allow. The \nappropriate means and methods to measure and quant ify those material risks are likely to vary \nacross banks. 114 \n   \nSome of the risks to which banks are exposed include credit risk, market risk, operational risk, \ninterest rate risk in the banking book, credit concentration risk and liquidity risk (as briefly outlined below). The RBI has issued guidelines to the banks on asset liability management, \nmanagement of country risk, credit risk, operational risk, etc., from time to time.  A bank\u2019s risk \nmanagement processes, including its ICAAP, should, therefore, be consistent with this \nexisting body of guidance . However, certain other risks, such as reputational risk and business \nor strategic risk, may be equally important for a bank and, in such cases, should be given same \nconsideration as the more formally defined risk types. For example, a bank may be engaged in \nbusinesses for which periodic fluctuations in activity levels, combined with relatively high fixed \ncosts, have the potential to create unanticipated losses that must be supported by adequate capital. Additionally, a bank might be involved in  strategic activities (such as expanding business \nlines or engaging in acquisitions) that introduce significant elements of risk and for which additional capital would be appropriate. \n \nAdditionally, if banks employ risk mitigation techniques, they should understand the risk to be \nmitigated and the potential effects of that mitigation, reckoning its enforceability and effectiveness, on the risk profile of the bank. \n13.2      Credit risk : A bank should have the ability to assess credit risk at the portfolio level as \nwell as at the exposure or counterparty level. Banks should be particularly attentive to identifying \ncredit risk concentrations and ensuring that their effects are adequately assessed. This should include consideration of various types of dependence among exposures, incorporating the credit \nrisk effects of extreme outcomes, stress events, and shocks to the assumptions made about the \nportfolio and exposure behavior. Banks should also carefully assess concentrations in \ncounterparty credit exposures, including counterparty credit risk exposures emanating from \ntrading in less liquid markets, and determine the effect that these might have on the bank\u2019s capital adequacy. \n \n13.3 Market risk : A bank should be able to identify risks in trading activities resulting from a \nmovement in market prices. This determination should consider factors such as illiquidity of \ninstruments, concentrated positions, one-way markets, non-linear/deep out-of-the money \npositions, and the potential for significant shifts in correlations. Exercises that incorporate \nextreme events and shocks should also be tailored to capture key portfolio vulnerabilities to the \nrelevant market developments.  \n 115 \n 13.4 Operational risk : A bank should be able to assess the potential risks resulting from \ninadequate or failed internal processes, people, and sy stems, as well as from events external to \nthe bank. This assessment should include the effects of extreme events and shocks relating to \noperational risk. Events could include a sudden increase in failed processes across business \nunits or a significant incidence of failed internal controls. \n \n13.5 Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) : A bank should identify the risks associated \nwith the changing interest rates on its on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures in the \nbanking book from both, a short-term and long-term perspective. This might include the impact of \nchanges due to parallel shocks, yield curve twists, yield curve inversions, changes in the relationships of rates (basis risk), and other relevant scenarios. The bank should be able to \nsupport its assumptions about the behavioral characteristics of its non-maturity deposits and \nother assets and liabilities, especially those exposures characterised by embedded optionality. \nGiven the uncertainty in such assumptions, stress testing and scenario analysis should be used \nin the analysis of interest rate risks. While t here could be several approaches to measurement of \nIRRBB, an \nillustrative  approach for measurement of IRRBB is furnished at Annex 10.  The \nbanks would, however, be free to adopt any other variant of these approaches or entirely \ndifferent methodology for computing / quantifying the IRRBB provided the technique is based on \nobjective, verifiable and transparent methodology and criteria.   \n \n13.6      Credit concentration risk:  A risk concentration is any single exposure or a group of \nexposures with the potential to produce losses large enough (relative to a bank\u2019s capital, total \nassets, or overall risk level) to threaten a bank\u2019s health or ability to maintain its core operations. \nRisk concentrations have arguably been the single most important cause of major problems in \nbanks. Concentration risk resulting from concentrated portfolios could be significant for most of \nthe banks.  \n \nThe following qualitative criteria  could be adopted by the banks to demonstrate that the credit \nconcentration risk is being adequately addressed: \n \na) While assessing the exposure to concentration risk, a bank should keep in view \nthat the calculations of Basel II framework are based on the assumption that a \nbank is well diversified.  \n \nb) While the banks\u2019 single borrower exposures, the group borrower exposures and \ncapital market exposures are regulated by the exposure norms prescribed by the \nRBI, there could be concentrations in these portfolios as well. In assessing the degree of credit concentration, therefore, a bank shall consider not only the 116 \n foregoing exposures but also consider the degree of credit concentration in a \nparticular economic sector or geographical area. The banks with operational \nconcentration in a few geographical regions, by virtue of the pattern of their \nbranch network, shall also consider the impact of adverse economic developments in that region, and their impact on the asset quality.  \n \nc) The performance of specialised portfolios may, in some instances, also depend \non key individuals / employees of the bank. Such a situation could exacerbate the \nconcentration risk because the skills of those individuals, in part, limit the risk \narising from a concentrated portfolio. The impact of such key employees / \nindividuals on the concentration risk is likely to be correspondingly greater in \nsmaller banks. In developing its stress tests and scenario analyses, a bank  shall, \ntherefore, also consider the impact of losing key personnel on its ability to operate normally, as well as the direct impact on its revenues. \n \nAs regards the quantitative criteria  to be used to ensure that credit concentration risk is being \nadequately addressed, the credit concentration risk calculations shall be performed at the \ncounterparty level (i.e., large exposures), at the portfolio level (i.e., sectoral and geographical \nconcentrations) and at the asset class level (i.e., liability and assets concentrations). In this regard, a reference is invited to paragraph 3.2.2 (c) of the Annex to our Circular \nDBOD.No.BP.(SC).BC.98/ 21.04.103/ 99 dated October 7, 1999 regarding Risk Management \nSystem in Banks in terms of which certain prudential limits have been stipulated in regard to \n\u2018substantial exposures\u2019 of banks. As a prudent practice, the banks may like to ensure that their aggregate exposure (including non-funded exposures) to all \u2018large borrowers\u2019 does not exceed at any time, 800 per cent of their \u2018capital funds\u2019 (as defined for the purpose of extant exposure norms of the RBI). The \u2018large borrower\u2019 for this purpose could be taken to mean as one to whom \nthe bank\u2019s aggregate exposure (funded as well as non-funded) exceeds 10 per cent of the \nbank\u2019s capital funds. The banks would also be well advised to pay special attention to their industry-wise exposures where their exposure to a particular industry exceeds 10 per cent of their aggregate credit exposure (including investment exposure) to the industrial sector as a \nwhole.   \n \nThere could be several approaches to the measurement of credit concentration the banks\u2019 \nportfolio. One of the approaches commonly used for the purpose involves computation of \nHerfindahl-Hirshman Index (HHI). It may please be noted that the HHI as a measure of concentration risk is only one of the possible methods and the banks would be free to adopt any other appropriate method for the purpose, which has objective and transparent criteria for such \nmeasurement.    \nRisk concentrations should be analysed on both solo and consolidated basis. 117 \n Risk concentrations should be viewed in the context of a single or a set of closely \nrelated risk-drivers that may have different impacts on a bank. These \nconcentrations should be integrated  when assessing a bank\u2019s overall risk \nexposure. A bank should consider concentrations that are based on common or \ncorrelated risk factors that reflect more subtle or more situation-specific factors than traditional concentrations, such as correlations between market, credit risks \nand liquidity risk. \n \nThe growth of market-based intermediat ion has increased the possibility that \ndifferent areas of a bank are exposed to  a common set of products, risk factors \nor counterparties. This has created new challenges for risk aggregation and \nconcentration management. Through its risk management processes and MIS, a \nbank should be able to identify and aggregate similar risk exposures across the \nfirm, including across legal entities, asset  types (eg loans, derivatives and \nstructured products), risk areas (eg the trading book) and geographic regions. In \naddition to the situations described in pa ra 13.6 (b) above,  risk concentrations \ncan arise include: \n \n\u2022 exposures to a single counterpa rty, or group of connected \ncounterparties ; \n \n\u2022 exposures to both regulated and non-regulated financial institutions \nsuch as hedge funds and private equity firms; \n \n\u2022 trading exposures/market risk; \n \n \n\u00be exposures to counterparties  (eg hedge funds and hedge \ncounterparties) through the execution or processing of transactions (either product or service); \n \n\u00be funding sources; \n \n\u00be assets that are held in the banking book or trading book, such as loans, derivatives and structured products; and \n \n\u00be off-balance sheet exposures, includi ng guarantees, liquidity lines \nand other commitments. \n \nRisk concentrations can al so arise through a combin ation of exposures across 118 \n these broad categories. A bank should have an understanding of its firm-wide \nrisk concentrations resulting from similar exposures across its different \nbusiness lines. Examples of such business lines include subprime exposure in \nlending books; counterparty exposur es; conduit exposures and SIVs; \ncontractual and non-contractual exposures;  trading activities; and underwriting \npipelines. While risk concentrations ofte n arise due to direct exposures to \nborrowers and obligors, a bank may also incur a concentration to a particular \nasset type indirectly through investments backed by such assets (eg \ncollateralised debt obligations \u2013 CDOs) , as well as exposure  to protection \nproviders guaranteeing the performance of the specific asset type (e.g. monoline insurers). In this context, it may be noted  that while banks in  India are presently \nnot allowed to pursue most of such business lines/assume most of such exposures without RBI\u2019s permission, thei r foreign branches may have such \nexposures booked before issu ance of circular DBOD.No. \nBP.BC.89/21.04.141/2008-09 dated December 1, 2008.  A bank should have in \nplace adequate, systematic procedures for identifying high correlation between \nthe creditworthiness of a protection provider and the obligors of the underlying \nexposures due to their performance be ing dependent on common factors beyond \nsystematic risk (ie \u201cwrong way risk\u201d). \n \nProcedures should be in place to communicate risk concentrations to the board \nof directors and senior management in a manner that clearly indicates where in \nthe organisation each segment of a risk concentration resides. A bank should \nhave credible risk mitigation strategies in place that have senior management \napproval. This may include altering bus iness strategies, reducing limits or \nincreasing capital buffers in line with the d esired risk profile. While it implements \nrisk mitigation strategies, the bank should  be aware of possible concentrations \nthat might arise as a result of em ploying risk mitigation techniques. \n \nBanks should employ a number of techni ques, as appropriate, to measure risk \nconcentrations. These techniques include shocks to various risk factors; use of \nbusiness level and firm-wide scenarios; and the use of integrated stress testing \nand economic capital models. Identified c oncentrations should be measured in a \nnumber of ways, including for example consideration of gross versus net \nexposures, use of notional amounts, and analysis of exposures with and without \ncounterparty hedges. A bank should est ablish internal position limits for \nconcentrations to which it may be exposed. When conducting periodic stress tests a bank should incorporate all majo r risk concentrations and identify and \nrespond to potential changes in market conditions that could adversely impact their performance and capital adequacy. \n \n The assessment of such risks under a bank \u2019s ICAAP and the supervisory review \nprocess should not be a mechanical pr ocess, but one in which each bank \ndetermines, depending on its business model, its own specific vulnerabilities. An 119 \n appropriate level of capital for risk conc entrations should be incorporated in a \nbank\u2019s ICAAP, as well as in Pillar 2 assessments. Each bank should discuss \nsuch issues with its supervisor. \n \nA bank should have in place effective internal policies,  systems and controls to \nidentify, measure, monitor, manage, control and mitigate its risk concentrations \nin a timely manner. Not only should norma l market conditions be considered, but \nalso the potential build-up of concentr ations under stressed market conditions, \neconomic downturns and periods of genera l market illiquidity. In addition, the \nbank should assess scenarios that consider possible concentrations arising \nfrom contractual and non-contractual c ontingent claims. The scenarios should \nalso combine the potential build-up of pipeline exposures together with the loss of market liquidity and a signi ficant decline in asset values. \n \n \n \n13.7     Liquidity risk : A bank should understand the risks resulting from its inability to meet \nits obligations as they come due, because of difficulty in liquidating assets (market liquidity risk) \nor in obtaining adequate funding (funding liquidity risk). This assessment should include analysis \nof sources and uses of funds, an understanding of the funding markets in which the bank \noperates, and an assessment of the efficacy of a contingency funding plan for events that could arise. \nThe recent financial market crisis underscores the importance of assessing the \npotential impact of liquidity risk on capit al adequacy in a bank\u2019s ICAAP. Senior \nmanagement should consider the relations hip between liquidity and capital since \nliquidity risk can impact capital adequacy which, in turn, can aggravate a bank\u2019s \nliquidity profile. \n \nIn September 2008, the Basel Commi ttee on Banking Supervision published \nPrinciples for Sound Liquidity Risk Manage ment and Supervision, which stresses \nthat banks need to have strong liquidity cushions in order to weather prolonged \nperiods of financial market stress and illiquidity. The standards address many of \nthe shortcomings experienced by the ba nking sector during the market turmoil \nthat began in mid-2007, including those related to stress testing practices  \ncontingency funding plans, management of on- and off-b alance sheet activity and \ncontingent commitments. \n \nThis liquidity guidance outlines requirement s for sound practices for the liquidity \nrisk management of banks. The fundamental  principle is that a bank should both \nassiduously manage its liquidi ty risk and also maintain  sufficient liquidity to \nwithstand a range of stress events. Liquidity  is a critical element of a bank\u2019s \nresilience to stress, and as such, a bank should maintain a liquidity cushion, made 120 \n up of unencumbered, high qua lity liquid assets, to  protect against liquidity stress \nevents, including potential losses of unsecu red and typically available secured \nfunding sources. \n  \nA key element in the management of liquidity risk is the need for strong \ngovernance of liquidity risk,  including the setting of a liquidity risk tolerance by \nthe board. The risk tolerance should be communicated throughout the bank and \nreflected in the strategy and policies that senior management set to manage \nliquidity risk. Another facet of liquidity risk management is that a bank should \nappropriately price the costs, benefits a nd risks of liquidity into the internal \npricing, performance measurement, and new product approval process of all \nsignificant business activities. \n \nA bank is expected to be able to thoroughl y identify, measure and control liquidity \nrisks, especially with regard to comple x products and contingent commitments \n(both contractual and non-contractual). This process should involve the ability to \nproject cash flows arising from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items over \nvarious time horizons, and should ensure diversification in both the tenor and \nsource of funding. A bank should utilise ear ly warning indicators to identify the \nemergence of increased risk or vulnerabili ties in its liquidity position or funding \nneeds. It should have the ability to control liquidity risk exposure and funding \nneeds, regardless of its organisation stru cture, within and acr oss legal entities, \nbusiness lines, and currencies, taking in to account any legal, regulatory and \noperational limitations to the transferability of liquidity. \n \nA bank\u2019s failure to effectively manage in traday liquidity could leave it unable to \nmeet its payment obligations at the time  expected, which could lead to liquidity \ndislocations that cascade quickly across many  systems and institutions. As such, \nthe bank\u2019s management of intraday liqui dity risks should be considered as a \ncrucial part of liquidity risk manageme nt. It should also actively manage its \ncollateral positions and have the ability to calculate all of its collateral positions. \n \nWhile banks typically manage liquidity under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances, they \nshould also be prepared to manage liquidity under \u201cstressed\u201d conditions. A bank should perform stress tests or scenario analyses on a regular basis in order to \nidentify and quantify their exposures to possible future liquidity stresses, \nanalysing possible impacts on the institut ions\u2019 cash flows, liquidity positions, \nprofitability, and solvency. The results of these stress tests should be discussed \nthoroughly by management, and based on this discussion, should form the basis \nfor taking remedial or mitiga ting actions to limit the bank\u2019s exposures, build up a \nliquidity cushion, and adjust its liquidity profile to fit it s risk tolerance. The results \nof stress tests should also play a key role  in shaping the bank\u2019s contingency \nfunding planning, which should outline po licies for managing a range of stress 121 \n events and clearly sets out strategies for addressing liquidity shortfalls in \nemergency situations. \n \nAs public disclosure increases certainty in the market, improves transparency, \nfacilitates valuation, and strengthens market  discipline, it is important that banks \npublicly disclose information on a regular b asis that enables market participants \nto make informed decisions about the soundness of their liquidity risk \nmanagement framework and liquidity position. \n \n13.8 Off-Balance sheet exposures and securitisation risk  \n \nBanks\u2019 use of securitisation has grown dramatically over the last several years. It \nhas been used as an alternative source of funding and as a mechanism to transfer \nrisk to investors. While the risks associated with securitisation are not new to \nbanks, the recent financial turmoil highlight ed unexpected aspects of credit risk, \nconcentration risk, market risk, liquidity risk, legal risk and reputational risk, \nwhich banks failed to adequately address.  For instance, a number of banks that \nwere not contractually obligated to s upport sponsored securitisation structures \nwere unwilling to allow those structures to  fail due to concerns about reputational \nrisk and future access to capital markets. The support of these structures exposed \nthe banks to additional and unexpected cr edit, market and liquidity risk as they \nbrought assets onto their balance sheets, which put significant pressure on their financial profile and capital ratios. \n \nWeaknesses in banks\u2019 risk management of securitisation and off-balance sheet \nexposures resulted in large unexpected losses during the financial crisis. To help mitigate these risks, a bank\u2019s on- and off-balance sheet securitisation activities \nshould be included in its risk management  disciplines, such as product approval, \nrisk concentration limits, a nd estimates of market, cred it and operational risk . \n \nIn light of the wide range of risks arisi ng from securitisation activities, which can \nbe compounded by rapid innovation in s ecuritisation techniques and instruments, \nminimum capital requirements calculated under Pillar 1 are often insufficient. All \nrisks arising from securitisation, particul arly those that are not fully captured \nunder Pillar 1, should be addressed in a bank\u2019s ICAAP. These risks include: \n \n\u2022 Credit, market, liquidity and re putational risk of each exposure; \n \n\u2022 Potential delinquencies and lo sses on the underlying securitised \nexposures; 122 \n  \n\u2022 Exposures from credit lines or liquidity facilities to special purpose \nentities;  \n \n\u2022 Exposures from guarantees provided by monolines and other third parties. \n  \nSecuritisation exposures should be included in  the bank\u2019s MIS to help ensure that \nsenior management understands the implicat ions of such exposures for liquidity, \nearnings, risk concentration and capital. More specifically, a bank should have the \nnecessary processes in place to capture in a timely manner updated information \non securitisation transactions including ma rket data, if available, and updated \nperformance data from the secu ritisation trustee or servicer. \n \n13.9 Reputational risk and implicit support  \n Reputational risk can be defined as the risk arising from negative perception on \nthe part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt-holders, \nmarket  analysts, other relevant parties or regulators that can adversely affect a \nbank\u2019s ability to maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships and \ncontinued access to sources of funding (eg through the interbank or securitisation markets). Reputational risk is multidimensional and reflects the \nperception of other market participants . Furthermore, it exists throughout the \norganisation and exposure to reputationa l risk is essentially a function of the \nadequacy of the bank\u2019s internal ri sk management processes, as well as the \nmanner and efficiency with which management responds to external influences on bank-related transactions. \n \nReputational risk can lead to the provision of implicit support, which may give rise \nto credit, liquidity, market and legal risk \u2013 all of which can have a negative impact \non a bank\u2019s earnings, liquidity and capital position. A bank should identify \npotential sources of reputational risk to which it is exposed. These include the \nbank\u2019s business lines, liabilities, affili ated operations, off-balance sheet vehicles \nand the markets in which it operates. The  risks that arise should be incorporated \ninto the bank\u2019s risk management proc esses and appropriately addressed in its \nICAAP and liquidity contingency plans. \n  \nPrior to the 2007 upheaval, many banks failed to recognise the reputational risk \nassociated with their off-balance sheet vehicles. In stressed conditions some \nfirms went beyond their contractual ob ligations to support their sponsored \nsecuritisations and off balance sheet ve hicles. A bank should incorporate the \nexposures that could give rise to reputat ional risk into its assessments of whether \nthe requirements under the securitisation framework have been met and the 123 \n potential adverse impact of providing implicit support. \n \nReputational risk may arise, for exampl e, from a bank\u2019s sponsorship of \nsecuritisation structures such as ABCP condui ts and SIVs, as well as from the \nsale of credit exposures to securitisation trusts. It may also arise from a bank\u2019s \ninvolvement in asset or funds manage ment, particularly when financial \ninstruments are issued by owned or spon sored entities and are distributed to the \ncustomers of the sponsoring bank. In th e event that the instruments were not \ncorrectly priced or the main risk driver s not adequately disclosed, a sponsor may \nfeel some responsibility to its customers, or be economically compelled, to cover \nany losses. Reputational risk also arises when a bank s ponsors activities such as \nmoney market mutual funds, in-house he dge funds and real estate investment \ntrusts. In these cases, a bank may decide to  support the value of shares/units held \nby investors even though is not contractually required to provide the support. \n \nThe financial market crisis has provid ed several examples of banks providing \nfinancial support that exceeded their contr actual obligations. In order to preserve \ntheir reputation, some bank s felt compelled to provid e liquidity support to their \nSIVs, which was beyond their contractual obligations. In ot her cases, banks \npurchased ABCP issued by vehicles they sponsored in order to maintain market \nliquidity. As a result, these banks assumed additional liquidity and credit risks, \nand also put pressure on capital ratios. \n \n Reputational risk also may a ffect a bank\u2019s liabilities, si nce market confidence and \na bank\u2019s ability to fund its business are closely related to its reputation. For \ninstance, to avoid damaging its reputation, a bank may call its liabilities even \nthough this might negatively aff ect its liquidity profile. This is particularly true for \nliabilities that are components of regulatory capital, such as hybrid/subordinated \ndebt. In such cases, a bank\u2019s capit al position is likely to suffer. \n \nBank management should have appropriate po licies in place to identify sources of \nreputational risk when entering new markets,  products or lines of activities. In \naddition, a bank\u2019s stress testing proced ures should take account of reputational \nrisk so management has a firm understanding of the consequences and second round effects of reputational risk. \n \nOnce a bank identifies potential exposures arising from reputational concerns, it \nshould measure the amount of support it mi ght have to provide (including implicit \nsupport of securitisations) or losses it might experience under adverse market \nconditions. In particular, in order to avo id reputational damages and to maintain \nmarket confidence, a bank should develop methodologies to measure as precisely as possible the effect of reputational risk in terms of other risk types (eg credit, 124 \n liquidity, market or operational risk) to which it may be exposed. This could be \naccomplished by including reputational risk scenarios in regular stress tests. For \ninstance, non-contractual off-balance sh eet exposures could be included in the \nstress tests to determine the effect on a ba nk\u2019s credit, market and liquidity risk \nprofiles. Methodologies also could in clude comparing the actual amount of \nexposure carried on the balance sheet  versus the maximum exposure amount \nheld off-balance sheet, that is, the potenti al amount to which the bank could be \nexposed. \n \nA bank should pay particular attention to  the effects of re putational risk on its \noverall liquidity position, taking into account both po ssible increases in the asset \nside of the balance sheet and possible restrictions on funding, should the loss of \nreputation result in various count erparties\u2019 loss of confidence. \n \nIn contrast to contractual credit expos ures, such as guarantees, implicit support \nis a more subtle form of exposure. Impl icit support arises when a bank provides \npost-sale support to a securitisation tran saction in excess of any contractual \nobligation. Implicit support may include any letter of comfort provided by the \noriginator in respect of the present or future liabilities of the SPV. Such non-\ncontractual support exposes a bank to the risk of loss, such as loss arising from \ndeterioration in the credit quality of the securitisatio n\u2019s underlying assets. \n \nBy providing implicit support, a bank signa ls to the market that all of the risks \ninherent in the securitised assets are still held by the organisation and, in effect, \nhad not been transferred. Since the risk arising from the potential provision of \nimplicit support is not captured ex ante under Pillar 1, it must be considered as \npart of the Pillar 2 process. In addition,  the processes for approving new products \nor strategic initiatives should consider th e potential provision of implicit support \nand should be incorporated in a bank\u2019s ICAAP. \n \n13.10 Risk evaluation and management \n \nA bank should conduct analyses of the unde rlying risks when investing in the \nstructured products (permitted by RBI) a nd must not solely rely on the external \ncredit ratings assigned to securitisation exposures by the credit rating agencies. \nA bank should be aware that external ratings are a useful starting point for credit \nanalysis, but are no substitute for full and proper understanding of the underlying \nrisk, especially where ratings for certa in asset classes have a short history or \nhave been shown to be volatile. Moreover, a bank also should conduct credit \nanalysis of the securitisation exposure at acquisition and on an ongoing basis. It \nshould also have in place th e necessary quantitative tool s, valuation models and \nstress tests of sufficient sophisticati on to reliably assess all relevant risks. 125 \n  \nWhen assessing securitisation exposures, a bank should ensure that it fully \nunderstands the credit quality and risk characteristics of the underlying \nexposures in structured credit transacti ons, including any risk concentrations. In \naddition, a bank should review the maturity of  the exposures underlying \nstructured credit transactions relative to the issued liabilities in order to assess \npotential maturity mismatches. \n \nA bank should track credit risk in securi tisation exposures at the transaction level \nand across securitisations exposures  within each business line and across \nbusiness lines. It should produce reliable m easures of aggregate risk. A bank also \nshould track all meaningful concentrations in securitisation exposures, such as \nname, product or sector concentrations, and feed this information to firm-wide risk aggregation systems that track, for example, credit exposure to a particular \nobligor. \n \nA bank\u2019s own assessment of  risk needs to be based on a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the structure of the securi tisation transaction. It should identify \nthe various types of triggers, credit even ts and other legal provisions that may \naffect the performance of its on- and off-balance sheet exposures and integrate \nthese triggers and provisions into its f unding/liquidity, credit and balance sheet \nmanagement. The impact of the events or tr iggers on a bank\u2019s liquidity and capital \nposition should also be considered. \n \nBanks globally, either underestimated or did not anticipate that a market-wide \ndisruption could prevent them from securitising warehoused or pipeline \nexposures and did not anticipate the effe ct this could have on liquidity, earnings \nand capital adequacy. As part of its risk management processes, a bank should \nconsider and, where appropriate, mark -to-market warehoused positions, as well \nas those in the pipeline, regardless of the probability of securitising the \nexposures. It should consider scenarios wh ich may prevent it from securitising its \nassets as part of its stress testing and identify the potential effect of such \nexposures on its liquidity, ear nings and capital adequacy. \n \nA bank should develop prudent contingency plans specifying how it would \nrespond to funding, capital and other pr essures that arise when access to \nsecuritisation markets is reduced. The c ontingency plans should also address \nhow the bank would address valuation cha llenges for potentially  illiquid positions \nheld for sale or for trading. The risk  measures, stress testing results and \ncontingency plans should be incorporated into the bank\u2019s risk management \nprocesses and its ICAAP, and should result  in an appropriate level of capital \nunder Pillar 2 in excess of the minimum requirements. 126 \n  \nA bank that employs risk mitigation techniques should fully understand the risks \nto be mitigated, the potential effects of  that mitigation and whether or not the \nmitigation is fully effective. This is to help ensure that the bank does not \nunderstate the true risk in its assessment  of capital. In particular, it should \nconsider whether it would provide support to the securitisation structures in \nstressed scenarios due to the relia nce on securitisation as a funding tool. \n \n13.11   Valuation Practices  \nThe characteristics of complex structured products, including securitisation transactions, \nmake their valuation inherently difficult due, in part, to the absence of active and liquid \nmarkets, the complexity and uniqueness of the cash waterfalls, and the links between \nvaluations and underlying risk factors. As mentioned earlier, banks in India are presently \nnot allowed to assume such exposures without RBI\u2019s permission. However, their foreign \nbranches may have such exposures booked before issuance of circular DBOD.No. BP.BC.89/21.04.141/2008-09 dated December 1, 2008.  The absence of a transparent price from a liquid market means that the valuation must rely on models or proxy-pricing methodologies, as well as on expert judgment. The outputs of such models and \nprocesses are highly sensitive to the inputs and parameter assumptions adopted, which \nmay themselves be subject to estimation error and uncertainty. Moreover, calibration of the valuation methodologies is often complicated by the lack of readily available benchmarks. Therefore, a bank is expected to have adequate governance structures and control processes for fair valuing exposures for risk management and financial reporting \npurposes. The valuation governance structures and related processes should be \nembedded in the overall governance structure of the bank, and consistent for both risk management and reporting purposes. The governance structures and processes are expected to explicitly cover the role of the board and senior management. In addition, the board should receive reports from senior management on the valuation oversight and \nvaluation model performance issues that are brought to senior management for \nresolution, as well as all significant changes to valuation policies. \n A bank should also have clear an d robust governance structures for the \nproduction, assignment and verification of  financial instrument valuations. \nPolicies should ensure that the approval s of all valuation methodologies are well \ndocumented. In addition, policies and procedures should set forth the range of \nacceptable practices for the initial prici ng, marking-to-market/model, valuation \nadjustments and periodic independent  revaluation. New product approval \nprocesses should include all internal stake holders relevant to risk measurement, \nrisk control, and the assignment and verification of valuations of financial instruments. \n  \nA bank\u2019s control processes for measuri ng and reporting valuations should be \nconsistently applied across the firm and integrated with risk measurement and \nmanagement processes. In particular, valuation controls should be applied \nconsistently across similar instruments (risks) and consistent across business 127 \n lines (books). These controls should be subj ect to internal audit. Regardless of \nthe booking location of a new product, reviews and approval of valuation \nmethodologies must be guided by a minimum set of considerations. Furthermore, \nthe valuation/new product approval process should be supported by a \ntransparent, well-documented inventory  of acceptable val uation methodologies \nthat are specific to products and businesses. \n \nIn order to establish and verify valuations for instruments and transactions in \nwhich it engages, a bank must have adequate capacity, including during periods of stress. This capacity should be commen surate with the importance, riskiness \nand size of these exposures in the context of the business profile of the \ninstitution. In addition, for those exposur es that represent material risk, a bank is \nexpected to have the capacity to produce valuations using alternative methods in the event that primary inputs and approaches become unreliable, unavailable or \nnot relevant due to market discontinuities or illiquidity . A bank must test and \nreview the performance of its models under stress conditions so that it \nunderstands the limitations of th e models under stress conditions. \n \nThe relevance and reliability of valuations  is directly related to the quality and \nreliability of the inputs. A bank is expected to apply the accounting guidance \nprovided to determine the relevant market  information and other factors likely to \nhave a material effect on an instrument's fair value when selecting the appropriate \ninputs to use in the valuation process. Wh ere values are determined to be in an \nactive market, a bank should maximise th e use of relevant observable inputs and \nminimise the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a \nvaluation technique. However, where a mar ket is deemed inactive, observable \ninputs or transactions may not  be relevant, such as in a forced liquidation or \ndistress sale, or transactions may not be  observable, such as when markets are \ninactive. In such cases, accounting fair value guidance provides assistance on \nwhat should be considered, but may not be determinative. In assessing whether a \nsource is reliable and relevant, a bank  should consider, among other things: \n \n\u2022 the frequency and availab ility of the prices/quotes; \n \n\u2022 whether those prices represent actual regularly occurring transactions \non an   arm's length basis; \n \n\u2022 the breadth of the distribution of th e data and whether it is generally \navailable to the relevant participants in the market; \n \n\u2022 the timeliness of the info rmation relative to the frequency of valuations; \n 128 \n \u2022 the number of independent sour ces that produce the quotes/prices; \n \n\u2022 whether the quotes/prices are supported by actual transactions; \n \n\u2022 the maturity of the market; and \n \n \n\u2022    the similarity between the financial instrument sold in a transaction and \nthe \ninstrument held by the institution. \n  \nA bank\u2019s external reporting should provide timely, relevant, reliable and decision \nuseful information that promotes transparency. Senior management should \nconsider whether disclosures around valu ation uncertainty can be made more \nmeaningful. For instance, the bank ma y describe the modelling techniques and \nthe instruments to which they are applied; the sensitivity of fair values to \nmodelling inputs and assumptions; and th e impact of stress scenarios on \nvaluations. A bank should regularly review its disclosure policies to ensure that \nthe information disclosed continues to be relevant to its business model and \nproducts and to current market conditions. \n \n \n13.12 Sound Stress Testing Practices  \n \nStress testing is an important tool that is used by banks as part of their internal \nrisk management that alerts bank management to adverse unexpected outcomes \nrelated to a broad variety of risks, and provides an indication to banks of how \nmuch capital might be needed to abso rb losses should large shocks occur. \nMoreover, stress testing supplements ot her risk management approaches and \nmeasures. It plays a particularly important role in: \n \n\u2022 providing forward looking assessments of risk, \n \n\u2022 overcoming limitations of mo dels and historical data, \n \n\u2022 supporting internal and external communication, 129 \n  \n\u2022 feeding into capital and liquidity planning procedures, \n \n\u2022 informing the setting of a banks\u2019 risk tolerance, \n \n\u2022 addressing existing or potential, firm-wide risk concentrations, and \n \n\u2022 facilitating the development of risk mitigation or contingency plans across \na range of stressed conditions. \n \nStress testing is especially important a fter long periods of benign risk, when the \nfading memory of negative economic conditi ons can lead to co mplacency and the \nunderpricing of risk, and when innovati on leads to the rapid growth of new \nproducts for which there is limited or no loss data. \n \nIt should be recognised that improvemen ts in stress testing alone cannot address \nall risk management weaknesses, but as part of a comprehensive approach, \nstress testing has a leading role to play in strengthening bank corporate \ngovernance and the resilience of individual banks and the financial system. \n \nStress testing should form an integral pa rt of the overall governance and risk \nmanagement culture of the bank. Board and senior management involvement in \nsetting stress testing object ives, defining scenarios, discussing the results of \nstress tests, assessing potenti al actions and decision making is critical in \nensuring the appropriate use of stress testing in banks\u2019 risk governance and \ncapital planning. Senior management should take an active interest in the \ndevelopment in, and operation of, stress test ing. The results of stress tests should \ncontribute to strategic decision making and foster internal debate regarding assumptions, such as the cost, risk and sp eed with which new capital could be \nraised or that positions could be hedge d or sold. Board and senior management \ninvolvement in the stress testing program is essential for its effective operation. \n \n \nA bank\u2019s capital planning process should  incorporate rigorous; forward looking \nstress testing that identifies possible events or changes in  market conditions that \ncould adversely impact the bank. Banks, under their ICAAPs  should examine \nfuture capital resources and capital requirements under adverse scenarios. In \nparticular, the results of forward-look ing stress testing should be considered \nwhen evaluating the adequacy of a bank\u2019s capital buffer. Capital adequacy should 130 \n be assessed under stressed conditions against a variety of capital ratios, \nincluding regulatory ratios, as well as ratios based on the bank\u2019s internal definition of capital resources.  In addition, the possibility that a crisis impairs the \nability of even very healthy banks to raise funds at reasonable cost should be \nconsidered. \n \nA bank should develop methodologies to measure  the effect of reputational risk in \nterms of other risk types, namely credit, liquidity, market and other risks that they \nmay be exposed to in order to avoid reputational damages and in order to \nmaintain market confidence. This could be done by including reputational risk \nscenarios in regular stress tests. For instance, including non-contractual off-\nbalance sheet exposures in the stress test s to determine the effect on a bank\u2019s \ncredit, market and liqui dity risk profiles.  \n \n A bank should carefully assess the risks with respect to commitments to off-\nbalance sheet vehicles and third-party firms related to structured credit securities \nand the possibility that assets will need to be taken on balance sheet for \nreputational reasons. Therefore, in its stress testing programme, a bank should \ninclude scenarios assessing the size and s oundness of such vehicles and firms \nrelative to its own financial, liquidity and regulatory capital positions. This \nanalysis should include structural, sol vency, liquidity and other risk issues, \nincluding the effects of covenants and triggers. \n \n \n \n13.13 Sound Compensation Practices  \n \n Risk management must be embedded in the culture of a bank. It should be a \ncritical focus of the CEO/Managing Dir ector, Chief Risk Offi cer (CRO), senior \nmanagement, trading desk and other business line heads and employees in \nmaking strategic and day-to-day deci sions. For a broad and deep risk \nmanagement culture to develop and be maintained over time, compensation \npolicies must not be unduly linked to s hort-term accounting profit generation. \nCompensation policies should be linked to longer-term capital preservation and \nthe financial strength of the firm, and should consider risk-adjusted performance measures. In addition, a bank should pr ovide adequate disclosure regarding its \ncompensation policies to stakeholders. Each  bank\u2019s board of directors and senior \nmanagement have the responsibility to mitigate the risks arising from remuneration policies in order to ensure  effective firm-wide risk management. \n \nCompensation practices at large financial institutions are one factor among many 131 \n that contributed to the financial crisis  that began in 2007. High short-term profits \nled to generous bonus payments to employees without adequate regard to the \nlonger-term risks they imposed on their firms. These incentives amplified the \nexcessive risk-taking that has threatened the global fina ncial system and left firms \nwith fewer resources to absorb losses as risks materialised. The lack of attention \nto risk also contributed to the large, in some cases extreme absolute level of \ncompensation in the industry. As a resu lt, to improve compensation practices and \nstrengthen supervision in this area, partic ularly for systemically important firms, \nthe Financial Stability Board (formerly th e Financial Stability Forum) published its \nPrinciples for Sound Compensation Practices in April 2009.  \n \nA bank\u2019s board of directors must act ively oversee the compensation system\u2019s \ndesign and operation, which should not be controlled primarily by the chief executive officer and management team. Relevant board members and employees \nmust have independence and expertise in risk management and compensation. In \naddition, the board of directors must monitor and review the compensation \nsystem to ensure the system includes adequate controls and operates as \nintended. The practical operation of the system should be regularly reviewed to \nensure compliance with policies and procedures. Compensation outcomes, risk \nmeasurements, and risk outcomes should be  regularly reviewed for consistency \nwith intentions. \n \nStaff that are engaged in the financial and risk control areas must be independent, \nhave appropriate authority, and be compen sated in a manner that is independent \nof the business areas they oversee and co mmensurate with their key role in the \nfirm. Effective independence and appropriate authority of such staff is necessary \nto preserve the integrity of financial and risk management\u2019s influence on incentive compensation. \n \nCompensation must be adjusted for all types of risk so that renumeration is \nbalanced between the profit earned and th e degree of risk assumed in generating \nthe profit. In general, both quantitative measures and human judgment should \nplay a role in determining the appropriate  risk adjustments, including those that \nare difficult to measure such as liquidity risk and reputation risk. \n \nCompensation outcomes must be symmetric with risk outcomes and \ncompensation systems should link the size  of the bonus pool to the overall \nperformance of the firm. Employees\u2019 incentive payments should be linked to the \ncontribution of the individual and business to the firm\u2019s over all performance. \n \nCompensation payout schedules must be sen sitive to the time horizon of risks. \nProfits and losses of different activities of  a financial firm are realiszed over 132 \n different periods of time. Variable co mpensation payments should be deferred \naccordingly. Payments should not be fina lised over short periods where risks are \nrealised over long periods. Management should question payouts for income that \ncannot be realised or whose likelihood of realisation remains uncertain at the time \nof payout. \n \nThe mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation must be consistent with \nrisk alignment. The mix will vary depend ing on the employee\u2019s position and role. \nThe firm should be able to expla in the rationale for its mix. \n \nRBI will review compensation practices in  a rigorous and sustained manner and \ndeficiencies, if any, will be addressed pr omptly with the appropriate supervisory \naction.   \n \n \n13.14     The risk factors discussed above should not be considered an exhaustive list  of those \naffecting any given bank. All relevant factors that present a material source of risk to capital \nshould be incorporated in a well-developed ICAAP. Furthermore, banks should be mindful of the \ncapital adequacy effects of concentrations that may arise within each risk type. \n \n13.15      Quantitative and qualitative approaches in ICAAP\n \n(a) All measurements of risk incorporate both quantitative and qualitative elements, but to the \nextent possible, a quantitative approach should form the foundation of a bank\u2019s measurement \nframework. In some cases, quantitative tools c an include the use of large historical databases; \nwhen data are more scarce, a bank may choose to rely more heavily on the use of stress testing \nand scenario analyses. Banks should understand when measuring risks that measurement error \nalways exists, and in many cases the error is itself difficult to quantify. In general, an increase in \nuncertainty related to modeling and business complexity should result in a larger capital cushion. \n \n(b)      Quantitative approaches that focus on most likely outcomes for budgeting, forecasting, \nor performance measurement purposes may not be fully applicable for capital adequacy \nbecause the ICAAP should also take less likely events into account. Stress testing and scenario \nanalysis can be effective in gauging the consequences of outcomes that are unlikely but would have a considerable impact on safety and soundness. \n \n(c)     To the extent that risks cannot be reliably measured with quantitative tools \u2013 for \nexample, where measurements of risk are based on scarce data or unproven quantitative \nmethods \u2013 qualitative tools, including exper ience and judgment, may be more heavily utilised. 133 \n Banks should be cognisant that qualitative approaches have their own inherent biases and \nassumptions that affect risk assessment; accordingly, banks should recognise the biases and assumptions embedded in, and the limitations of, the qualitative approaches used. \n13.16   Risk aggregation and diversification effects \n(a)      An effective ICAAP should assess the risks across the entire bank. A bank choosing to conduct risk aggregation among various risk types or business lines should understand the challenges in such aggregation. In addition, when aggregating risks, banks should be ensure \nthat any potential concentrations across more than one risk dimension are addressed, \nrecognising that losses could arise in several risk dimensions at the same time, stemming from \nthe same event or a common set of factors. For example, a localised natural disaster could generate losses from credit, market, and operational risks at the same time. \n \n(b)   In considering the possible effects of diversification, management should be systematic and \nrigorous in documenting decisions, and in identifying assumptions used in each level of risk aggregation. Assumptions about diversification should be supported by analysis and evidence. \nThe bank should have systems capable of aggregating risks based on the bank\u2019s selected \nframework. For example, a bank calculating co rrelations within or among risk types should \nconsider data quality and consistency, and the volatility of correlations over time and under \nstressed market conditions. \n \nPart \u2013 C  : Market Discipline  \n \n14. Guidelines for Market Discipline \n \n14.1      General  \n14.1.1  The purpose of Market discipline (detailed in Pillar 3) in the Revised Framework is to \ncomplement the minimum capital requirements (detailed under Pillar 1) and the supervisory \nreview process (detailed under Pillar 2). The aim is to encourage market discipline by developing \na set of disclosure requirements which will allow market participants to assess key pieces of information on the scope of application, capital, risk exposures, risk assessment processes, and \nhence the capital adequacy of the institution. \n \n14.1.2   In principle, banks\u2019 disclosures should be consistent with how senior management and \nthe Board of directors assess and manage the risks of the bank. Under Pillar 1, banks use \nspecified approaches/ methodologies for measuring the various risks they face and the resulting 134 \n capital requirements. It is believed that providing disclosures that are based on a common \nframework is an effective means of informing the market about a bank\u2019s exposure to those risks and provides a consistent and comprehensive disclosure framework that enhances comparability \n \n14.2     Achieving appropriate disclosure \n14.2.1   Market discipline can contribute to a safe and sound banking environment. Hence, non-compliance with the prescribed disclosure requirements would attract a penalty, including financial penalty. However, it is not intended that direct additional capital requirements would be \na response to non-disclosure, except as indicated below. \n \n14.2.2   In addition to the general intervention measures, the Revised Framework also \nanticipates a role for specific measures. Where disclosure is a qualifying criterion under Pillar 1 to obtain lower risk weightings and/or to apply specific methodologies, there would be a direct \nsanction (not being allowed to apply the lower risk weighting or the specific methodology). \n \n14.3     Interaction with accounting disclosures  \nIt is recognised that the Pillar 3 disclosure framework does not conflict with requirements under \naccounting standards, which are broader in scope. The BCBS has taken considerable efforts to see that the narrower focus of Pillar 3, which is aimed at disclosure of bank capital adequacy, \ndoes not conflict with the broader accounting requirements. The Reserve Bank will consider \nfuture modifications to the Market Discipline disclosures as necessary in light of its ongoing \nmonitoring of this area and industry developments. \n14.4   Scope and frequency of disclosures \n \n14.4.1    Banks, including consolidated banks, should provide all Pillar 3 disclosures, both qualitative and quantitative, as at end March each year along with the annual financial \nstatements. With a view to enhance the ease of access to the Pillar 3 disclosures, banks may make their annual disclosures both in their annual reports as well as their respective web sites. Banks with capital funds of Rs.100 crore or more should make interim disclosures on the \nquantitative aspects, on a stand alone basis, on their respective websites as at end September \neach year. Qualitative disclosures that provide a general summary of a bank\u2019s risk management objectives and policies, reporting system and definitions may be published only on an annual basis.  \n \n14.4.2    In recognition of the increased risk sensitivity of the Revised Framework and the \ngeneral trend towards more frequent reporting in capital markets, all banks with capital funds of 135 \n                                            Rs. 500 crore or more, and their significant bank subsidiaries, must disclose their Tier I capital, \ntotal capital, total required capital and Tier I ratio and total capital adequacy ratio, on a quarterly basis on their respective websites.  \n \n14.4.3    The disclosure on the websites should be made in a web page titled \u201cBasel II \nDisclosures\u201d and the link to this page should be prominently provided on the home page of the \nbank\u2019s website. Each of these disclosures pertaining to a financial year should be available on the websites until disclosure of the third subsequent annual (March end) disclosure\n29 is made. \n \n14.5  Validation \n \nThe disclosures in this manner should be subjected to adequate validation. For example, since \ninformation in the annual financial statements would generally be audited, the additional material published with such statements must be consistent with the audited statements. In addition, \nsupplementary material (such as Management\u2019 s Discussion and Analysis) that is published \nshould also be subjected to sufficient scrutiny (e.g. internal control assessments, etc.) to satisfy \nthe validation issue. If material is not published under a validation regime, for instance in a stand alone report or as a section on a website, then management should ensure that appropriate verification of the information takes place, in accordance with the general disclosure principle set out below. In the light of the above, Pillar 3 disclosures will not be required to be audited by an \nexternal auditor, unless specified.  \n14.6   Materiality \n \nA bank should decide which disclosures are relevant for it based on the materiality concept. \nInformation would be regarded as material if its omission or misstatement could change or influence the assessment or decision of a user relying on that information for the purpose of \nmaking economic decisions. This definition is consistent with International Accounting Standards \nand with the national accounting framework. The Reserve Bank recognises the need for a \nqualitative judgment of whether, in light of the particular circumstances, a user of financial \ninformation would consider the item to be material (user test). The Reserve Bank does not \nconsider it necessary to set specific thresholds  for disclosure as the user test is a useful \nbenchmark for achieving sufficient disclosure. However, with a view to facilitate smooth transition \nto greater disclosures as well as to promote greater comparability among the banks\u2019 Pillar 3 \ndisclosures, the materiality thresholds have been prescribed for certain limited disclosures. \n \n29 For example: Disclosures for the financial year ending March 31, 2009 (i.e., June/ September/ December 2008 and 136 \n                                                                                                                                              Notwithstanding the above, banks are encouraged to apply the user test to these specific \ndisclosures and where considered necessary make disclosures below the specified thresholds \nalso.  \n \n14.7   Proprietary and confidential information \n \nProprietary information encompasses information (for example on products or systems), that if shared with competitors would render a bank\u2019s investment in these products/systems less valuable, and hence would undermine its competitiv e position. Information about customers is \noften confidential, in that it is provided under  the terms of a legal agreement or counterparty \nrelationship. This has an impact on what banks should reveal in terms of information about their \ncustomer base, as well as details on their internal arrangements, for instance methodologies used, parameter estimates, data etc. The Reserve Bank believes that the requirements set out \nbelow strike an appropriate balance between the need for meaningful disclosure and the \nprotection of proprietary and confidential information.  \n \n14.8   General disclosure principle \n \nBanks should have a formal disclosure policy appr oved by the Board of directors that addresses \nthe bank\u2019s approach for determining what disclosures  it will make and the internal controls over \nthe disclosure process. In addition, banks should implement a process for assessing the appropriateness of their disclosures, including validation and frequency. \n \n14.9    Scope of application \n \nPillar 3 applies at the top consolidated level of the banking group to which the Framework \napplies (as indicated above under paragraph 3  Scope of Application). Disclosures related to \nindividual banks within the groups would not generally be required to be made by the parent bank. An exception to this arises in the disclosure of Total and Tier I Capital Ratios by the top \nconsolidated entity where an analysis of significant bank subsidiaries within the group is \nappropriate, in order to recognise the need for these subsidiaries to comply with the Framework and other applicable limitations on the transfer of funds or capital within the group. Pillar 3 disclosures will be required to be made by the individual banks on a standalone basis when they \nare not the top consolidated entity in the banking group.  \n \nMarch 2009) should be available until disclosure as on March 31, 2012.  137 \n  \n14.10   Effective date of disclosures \n \nThe first of the disclosures as per these guidelines shall be made as on the effective date viz.  \nMarch 31, 2008 or 2009, as the case may be. Banks are, however, encouraged to make the \nPillar 3 disclosures at an earlier date. \n \n14.11 Revisions to Pillar III \n14.11.1 In response to observed weaknesses in  public disclosure and after a \ncareful assessment of lead ing disclosure practices, Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision decided to revise the cu rrent Pillar 3 requirements. Banks are \nexpected to comply with the revised requirements by March 31, 2010. These \nenhancements also respond to the Fina ncial Stability Board's recommendations \nfor strengthened Pillar 3 requirements  and draw upon the Senior Supervisors \nGroup's analysis of di sclosure practices. \n \n14.11.2. The Pillar 3 revisi ons include disclosure requirements that are not \nspecifically required to compute capital requirements under Pillar 1. This \ninformation, however, will help market participants to better understand the \noverall risk profile of an institution.  These enhanced disclosure requirements will \nhelp to avoid a recurrence of market uncertainties about the strength of banks\u2019 \nbalance sheets related to th eir securitisati on activities. \n \n14.11.3. It may be noted that beyond disclosure requirements as set forth under \nNew Capital Adequacy Framework, banks are responsible for conveying their actual risk profile to market  participants. The informat ion banks disclose must be \nadequate to fulfill this objective. \n14.11.4.  Banks operating in India s hould make additional disclosures in the \nfollowing areas:  \n \n(i) Securitisation exposures in the trading book; \n(ii) Sponsorship of off-balance sheet vehicles; \n(iii) Valuation with regard to  securitisation exposures; and \n(iv) Pipeline and warehousing risks with regard to securitisation exposures \n \n14.12  The disclosure requirements  \nThe following sections set out in tabular form are the disclosure requirements under Pillar 3.     \nAdditional definitions and explanations are provided in a series of footnotes.  \n                                              \n 138 \n            \nTable DF \u2013 1:  Scope of Application \n \nQualitative Disclosures \n(a)     The name of the top bank in the group to which the Framework applies. \n(b)   An outline of differences in the basis of consolidation for accounting and regulatory \npurposes, with a brief description of the entities 30 within the group    (i) that are fully \nconsolidated;31     (ii) that are pro-rata consolidated;32     (iii) that are given a deduction \ntreatment; and     (iv) that are neither  consolidated nor deducted (e.g. where the \ninvestment is risk-weighted). \nQuantitative Disclosures \n(c)    The aggregate amount of capital deficiencies33 in all subsidiaries not included in the \nconsolidation i.e. that are deducted an d the name(s) of such subsidiaries. \n(d)    The aggregate amounts (e.g. current book value) of the bank\u2019s total interests in \ninsurance entities, which are risk-weighted 34  as well as their name, their country of \nincorporation or residence, the proportion of  ownership interest and, if different, the \nproportion of voting power in these entities .

In this section, several key banking risks are considered: credit risk, \nmarket risk, and interest rate risk in the banking book and operational risk. Also included in this \nsection are disclosures relating to credit risk mitigation and asset securitisation, both of which \nalter the risk profile of the institution. Where applicable, separate disclosures are set out for banks using different approaches to the assessment of regulatory capital. \n14.14 General qualitative disclosure requirement \nFor each separate risk area (e.g. credit, market, operational, banking book interest rate risk) \nbanks must describe their risk management objectives and policies, including:  \n(i) strategies and processes; \n(ii) the structure and organisation of the relevant risk management function; \n(iii) the scope and nature of risk reporting and/or measurement systems; \n(iv) policies for hedging and/or mitigating risk and strategies and processes for \nmonitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges/mitigants. \nCredit risk \nGeneral disclosures of credit risk provide market participants with a range of information about \noverall credit exposure and need not necessarily be based on information prepared for \nregulatory purposes. Disclosures on the capital assessment techniques give information on the specific nature of the exposures, the means of capital assessment and data to assess the reliability of the information disclosed. 141 \n Table DF \u2013 4:  Credit Risk  : General Disclosures for All Banks \nQualitative Disclosures \n(a) The general qualitative disclosure requirement (paragraph 10.13 ) with respect to credit risk, \nincluding: \n\u2022 Definitions of past due and impaired (for accounting purposes); \n\u2022 Discussion of the bank\u2019s credit risk management policy;  \nQuantitative Disclosures   \n(b) Total gross credit risk exposures36, Fund based and Non-fund based separately. \n(c) Geographic distribution of exposures37, Fund based and Non-fund based separately \n\u2022 Overseas \n\u2022 Domestic \n(d) Industry38  type distribution of exposures, fund based and non-fund based separately  \n(e) Residual contractual maturity breakdown of assets,39  \n(f) Amount of NPAs (Gross) \n\u2022 Substandard \n\u2022 Doubtful 1 \n\u2022 Doubtful 2 \n\u2022 Doubtful 3 \n\u2022 Loss  \n(g) Net NPAs  \n(h) NPA Ratios \n\u2022 Gross NPAs to gross advances \n\u2022 Net NPAs to net advances \n(i) Movement of NPAs (Gross) \n\u2022 Opening balance \n\u2022 Additions \n\u2022 Reductions \n\u2022 Closing balance \n(j) Movement of provisions for NPAs  \n\u2022 Opening balance \n\u2022 Provisions made during the period \n\u2022 Write-off  \n\u2022 Write-back of excess provisions \n\u2022 Closing balance \n(k) Amount of Non-Performing Investments \n(l) Amount of provisions held for non-performing investments \n(m) Movement of provisions for depreciation on investments \n\u2022 Opening balance \n\u2022 Provisions made during the period \n\u2022 Write-off  \n\u2022 Write-back of excess provisions \n\u2022 Closing balance \n                                            \n36 That is after accounting offsets in accordance with the applicable accounting regime and without taking into account \nthe effects of credit risk mitigation te chniques, e.g. collateral and netting.  \n37 That is, on the same basis as adopted for Segment Reporting adopted for compliance with AS 17.  \n38 The industries break-up may be provided on the same line s as prescribed for DSB returns. If the exposure to any \nparticular industry is more than 5 per cent of the gross credit exposure as computed under (b) above it should be \ndisclosed separately. \n39 Banks shall use the same maturity bands as us ed for reporting positions in the ALM returns. 142 \n       \n \nTable DF \u2013 5   \nCredit Risk:  Disclosures for Portfolios Subject to the Standardised Approach \n \nQualitative Disclosures \n(a)     For portfolios under the standardised approach: \n\u2022 Names of credit rating agencies used, plus reasons for any changes; \n\u2022 Types of exposure for which each agency is used; and \n\u2022 A description of the process used to transfer public issue ratings onto comparable \nassets in the banking book;  \nQuantitative Disclosures \n(b)       For exposure40 amounts after risk mitigation subject to the standardised approach, \namount of a bank\u2019s outstandings (rated and unrated) in the following three major risk buckets \nas well as those that are deducted;  \n\u2022 Below 100 % risk weight \n\u2022 100 % risk weight \n\u2022 More than 100 % risk weight \n\u2022 Deducted \n \nTable DF \u2013  6 \nCredit Risk Mitigation: Disclosures for Standardised Approaches 41\n \nQualitative Disclosures \n(a) The general qualitative disclosure requirement (paragraph 10.13 ) with respect \nto credit risk mitigation including: \n\u2022       Policies and proceses for, and an indication of the extent to which \nthe bank makes use of, on- and off-balance sheet netting; \n\u2022 policies and processes for collateral valuation and management; \n\u2022 a description of the main types of collateral taken by the bank; \n\u2022 the main types of guarantor counterparty and their ceditworthiness; and \n\u2022 information about (market or credit) risk concentrations within the \nmitigation taken  \n \n                                            \n40 As defined for disclosures in Table 4 \n41 At a minimum, banks must give the disclosures in this Table in relation to credit risk mitigation that has been \nrecognised for the purposes of reducing capital requir ements under this Framework.

Compliance with Reserve Requirements  \nThe total amount of Subordinated Debt raised by the bank has to be reckoned as liability for the \ncalculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, \nas such, will attract CRR/SLR requirements. \n5. Treatment of Investment in subordinated debt  \nInvestments by banks in subordinated debt of other banks will be assigned 100% risk weight \nfor capital adequacy purpose. Also, the bank's aggregate investment in Tier II bonds \nissued by other banks and financ ial institutions shall be within the overall ceiling of 10 \npercent of the investing bank's total capital. The capital for this purpose will be the same \nas that reckoned for the purpose of capital adequacy. \n \n6. Sign-off  requirement  \nWith a view to enhancing investor education relating to risk characteristics of regulatory \ncapital requirements, banks issuing subordinated debt to retail investors should adhere to the following conditions:  \n \na) The requirement for specific sign-off as quoted below, from the investors for \nhaving understood the features and risks of the instrument may be incorporated in the common application form of the proposed debt issue. \n \n\" By making this application, I/We acknowledge that I/We have understood the terms \nand conditions of the Issue of [ insert the name of the instruments being issued ] of \n[Name of The Bank ] as disclosed in the Draft Shelf Prospectus, Shelf Prospectus and Tranche Document  \". \n \nb)  For floating rate instruments, banks should not use its Fixed Deposit rate as benchmark. \n \nc) All the publicity material, application form and other communication with the investor \n  177    \nshould clearly state in bold letters ( with font size 14 ) how a subordinated bond is \ndifferent from fixed deposit particularly that it is not covered by deposit insurance. \n7. Subordinated Debt in foreign cu rrency raised by Indian banks   \nBanks may take approval of RBI on a case-by-case basis . \n8.

Para  5.16.1) \n \nExtracts from the \u2018Guidelines on Securitisation of Standard Assets\u2019 issued vide \ncircular DBOD.No.BP.C.60/21.04.048/2005-06 dated February 1, 2006\nScope\n1.        The regulatory framework provided in the guidelines covers securitisation of standard \nassets by banks, All India Term Lending and Refinancing Institutions, and Non Banking Financial Companies (including RNBCs). The reference to \u2018bank\u2019 in the guidelines would \ninclude all the above institutions. \n2.        Securitisation is a process by which assets are sold to a bankruptcy remote special \npurpose vehicle (SPV) in return for an immediate cash payment. The cash flow from the \nunderlying pool of assets is used to service the securities issued by the SPV. Securitisation \nthus follows a two-stage process. In the first stage there is sale of single asset or pooling and sale of pool of assets to a 'bankruptcy remote' special purpose vehicle (SPV) in return \nfor an immediate cash payment and in t he second stage repackaging and selling the \nsecurity interests representing claims on incoming cash flows from the asset or pool of \nassets to third party investors by issuance of tradable debt securities. \n3.        Banks\u2019 exposures to a securitisation transaction are referred to as \"securitisation \nexposures\". Securitisation exposures include, but are not restricted to the following: exposures to securities issued by the SPV, credit enhancement facility, liquidity facility, \nunderwriting facility, interest rate or currency swaps and cash collateral accounts. \u201c \n\u201cDefinition\n5.        The broad definitions of various terms used in these guidelines are furnished below. These terms have been supplemented as appropriate at various relevant portions of these guidelines. \n(i)    \"Bankruptcy remote\" means the unlikelihood of an entity being subjected to \nvoluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, including by the originator or its \ncreditors; \n(ii)    \"credit enhancement\" is provided to an SPV to cover the losses associated with \nthe pool of assets. The rating given to the securities issued by the SPV (PTCs) by a \nrating agency will reflect the level of enhancement; \n(iii)    A \"first loss facility\" represents the first level of financial support to a SPV as part \nof the process in bringing the securities issued by the SPV to investment grade. The \nprovider of the facility bears the bulk (or all) of the risks associated with the assets \nheld by the SPV; \n(iv)    A \"second loss facility\" represen ts a credit enhancement providing a second (or \nsubsequent) tier of protection to an SPV against potential losses; \n  181    \n(v)    \"Liquidity facilities\" enable SPVs to assure investors of timely payments. These include \nsmoothening of timing differences between payment of interest and principal on \npooled assets and payments due to investors; \n(vi)    \"Originator\" refers to a bank that transfers from its balance sheet a single asset or a \npool of assets to an SPV as a part of a se curitisation transaction and would include \nother entities of the consolidated group to which the bank belongs. \n(vii)    \"Securitisation\" means a process by which a single performing asset or a pool of \nperforming assets are sold to a bankruptcy remote SPV and transferred from the balance sheet of the originator to the SPV in return for an immediate cash payment; \n(viii)    \"Service provider\" means a bank that carries out on behalf of the SPV (a) \nadministrative functions relating to the cash flows of the underlying exposure or pool of exposures of a securitization; (b) funds management; and (c) servicing the investors; \n(ix)    \"SPV\" means any company, trust, or other entity constituted or established for a \nspecific purpose - (a) activities of which are limited to those for accomplishing the \npurpose of the company, trust or other entity as the case may be; and (b) which is \nstructured in a manner intended to isolate the corporation, trust or entity as the case \nmay be, from the credit risk of an originator to make it bankruptcy remote; \n(x)    \"Underwriting\" means the arrangement under which a bank agrees, before issue, to buy \na specified quantity of securities in a new issue on a given date and at a given price if \nno other purchaser has come forward. \nTrue Sale\n6.        For enabling the transferred assets to be removed from the balance sheet of the originator \nin a securitisation structure, the isolation of assets or \u2018true sale\u2019 from the originator to the \nSPV is an essential prerequisite. In case the assets are transferred to the SPV by the originator in full compliance with all the conditions of true sale given below, the transfer \nwould be treated as a 'true sale' and originator will not be required to maintain any capital \nagainst the value of assets so transferred from the date of such transfer. The effective date of such transfer should be expressly indicated in the subsisting agreement. In the event of the transferred assets not meeting the \"true-sale\" criteria the assets would be deemed to be \non the balance sheet of the originator and accordingly the originator would be required to \nmaintain capital for those assets. The criteria of true-sale that have been prescribed below are illustrative but not exhaustive. \n7.        The criteria for \"True Sale\" of assets  \n7.1    The sale should result in immediate legal separation of the originator from the assets \nwhich are sold to the new owner viz. the SPV. The assets should stand completely isolated \nfrom the originator, after its transfer to the SPV, i.e., put beyond the originator\u2019s as well as \ntheir creditors' reach, even in the event of bankruptcy of the originator. \n7.2    The originator should effectively transfer all risks / rewards and rights / obligations \npertaining to the asset and shall not hold any beneficial interest in the asset after its sale to \nthe SPV. An agreement entitling the originator to any surplus income on the securitised \nassets at the end of the life of the securities i ssued by the SPV would not be deemed as a        \n  182    \nviolation of the true sale criteria. The SPV should obtain the unfettered right to pledge, sell, \ntransfer or exchange or otherwise dispose of the assets free of any restraining condition. \n7.3    The originator shall not have any economic interest in the assets after its sale \nand the SPV shall have no recourse to the originator for any expenses or losses \nexcept those specifically permitted under these guidelines. \n7.4    There shall be no obligation on the originator to re-purchase or fund the re-\npayment of the asset or any part of it or substitute assets held by SPV or provide \nadditional assets to the SPV at any time except those arising out of breach of \nwarranties or representations made at the time of sale. The originator should be able to demonstrate that a notice to this effect has been given to the SPV and that the \nSPV has acknowledged the absence of such obligation. \n7.5    An option to repurchase fully performing assets at the end of the securitisation \nscheme where residual value of such assets has, in aggregate, fallen to less than \n10% of the original amount sold to the SPV (\"clean up calls\") as allowed vide \nparagraph 10 can be retained by the originator. \n7.6    The originator should be able to demonstrate that it has taken all reasonable \nprecautions to ensure that it is not obliged, nor will feel impelled, to support any \nlosses suffered by the scheme or investors. \n7.7    The sale shall be only on cash basis and the consideration shall be received \nnot later than at the time of transfer of assets to the SPV. The sale consideration \nshould be market-based and arrived at in a transparent manner on an arm's length \nbasis. \n7.8    Provision of certain services (such as credit enhancement, liquidity facility, \nunderwriting, asset-servicing, etc.) and assumption of consequent risks / obligations \nby the originators as specif ically allowed in these guidelines would not detract from \nthe 'true sale' nature of the transaction, provided such service obligations do not \nentail any residual credit risk on the assets securitized or any additional liability for \nthem beyond the contractual performance obligations in respect of such services. \n7.9    An opinion from the originating bank's Legal Counsel should be kept on record \nsignifying that: (i) all rights, titles, interests and benefits in the assets have been \ntransferred to SPV; (ii) originator is not li able to investors in any way with regard to \nthese assets other than liability for certain permitted contractual obligations for \nexample, credit enhancement / liquidity facility;  and (iii) creditors of the originator do \nnot have any right in any way with regard to these assets even in case of bankruptcy \nof the originator. \n7.10    Any re-schedulement, restructuring or re-negotiation of the terms of the \nunderlying agreement/s effected after the transfer of assets to the SPV, shall be \nbinding on the SPV and not on the originator and shall be done only with the express \nconsent of the investors, providers of credit enhancement and other service \nproviders. This should be expressly provided in the sale transaction documents. \n7.11    The transfer of assets from originator must not contravene the terms and \nconditions of any underlying agreement governing the assets and all necessary \nconsents from obligors (including from third parties, where necessary) should have \nbeen obtained. \n7.12    In case the originator also provides servicing of assets after securitisation, \nunder an agreement with the SPV, and the payments / repayments from the \nborrowers are routed through it, it shall be under no obligation to remit funds to the \nSPV / investors unless and until these are received from the borrowers. \n  183    \n7.13    The originator should not be under any obligation to purchase the securities issued \nby the SPV and should not subscribe to their primary issue. The originator may, however, \npurchase at market price only senior securiti es issued by the SPV if these are at least \n\u2018investment grade\u2019, for investment purposes. Such purchase, along with the securities that \nmay devolve on account of underwriting commitments, should not exceed 10% of the \noriginal amount of the issue. \n7.14    The originator shall not indulge in market-making or dealing in the securities issued \nby the  SPV. \n6.15    The securities issued by the SPV shall not have any put options. The securities may \nhave a call option to address the pre-payment risk on the underlying assets. \n \nCRITERIA TO BE MET BY SPV\n8.       SPV is a special purpose vehicle set up during the process of securitisation to which the \nbeneficial interest in the securitised assets are sold / transferred on a without recourse \nbasis. The SPV may be a partnership firm, a trust or a company. Any reference to SPV in these guidelines would also refer to the trust settled or declared by the SPV as a part of the process of securitisation. The SPV should meet t he following criteria to enable the originator \nto treat the assets transferred by it to the SPV as a true sale and apply the prudential guidelines on capital adequacy and other aspects with regard to the securitisation exposures assumed by it. \n8.1    Any transaction between the originator and the SPV should be strictly on arm\u2019s length \nbasis. Further, it should be ensured that any transaction with the SPV should not \nintentionally provide for absorbing any future losses. \n8.2    The SPV and the trustee should not resemble in name or imply any connection or \nrelationship with the originator of the assets in its title or name. \n8.3    The SPV should be entirely independent of the originator. The originator should not \nhave any ownership, proprietary or beneficial interest in the SPV. The originator should not \nhold any share capital in the SPV. \n8.4    The originator shall have only one representative, without veto power, on the board of \nthe SPV provided the board has at least four members and independent directors are in \nmajority. \n8.5    The originator shall not exercise control, directly or indirectly, over the SPV and the \ntrustees, and shall not settle the trust deed. \n8.6    The SPV should be bankruptcy remote and non-discretionary. \n8.7    The trust deed should lay down, in detail, the functions to be performed by the trustee, \ntheir rights and obligations as well as the rights and obligations of the investors in relation to \nthe securitised assets. The Trust Deed should not provide for any discretion to the trustee \nas to the manner of disposal and management or application of the trust property. In order to protect their interests, investors should be empowered in the trust deed to change the \ntrustee at any point of time. \n8.8    The trustee should only perform trus teeship functions in relation to the SPV and \nshould not undertake any other business with the SPV. \n  184    \n8.9    The originator shall not support the losses of the SPV except under the \nfacilities explicitly permitted under these guidelines and shall also not be liable to \nmeet the recurring expenses of the SPV. \n8.10    The securities issued by the SPV shall compulsorily be rated by a rating \nagency registered with SEBI and such rating at any time shall not be more than 6 \nmonths old. The credit rating should be publicly available. For the purpose of rating \nand subsequent updation, the SPV should supply the necessary information to the \nrating agency in a timely manner. Commonality and conflict of interest, if any, \nbetween the SPV and the rating agency should also be disclosed. \n8.11    The SPV should inform the investors in the securities issued by it that these \nsecurities are not insured and that they do not represent deposit liabilities of the \noriginator, servicer or trustees. \n8.12    A copy of the trust deed and the accounts and statement of affairs of the SPV should be made available to the RBI, if required to do so. \nSpecial Features\n9.        Representations and Warranties  \nAn originator that sells assets to SPV may make representations and warranties concerning \nthose assets. Where the following conditions are met the originator will not be required to hold capital against such representations and warranties. \n(a)    Any representation or warranty is provided only by way of a formal written \nagreement. \n(b)    The originator undertakes appropriate due diligence before providing or \naccepting any representation or warranty. \n(c)    The representation or warranty refers to an existing state of facts that is capable of being verified by the originator at the time the assets are sold. \n(d)    The representation or warranty is not open-ended and, in particular, does not \nrelate to the future creditworthiness of the assets, the performance of the SPV and / or \nthe securities the SPV issues. \n(e)    The exercise of a representation or warranty, requiring an originator to replace \nassets (or any parts of them) sold to a SPV, must be: \n*    undertaken within 120 days of the transfer of assets to the SPV; and \n*    conducted on the same terms and conditions as the original sale. \n(f)    An originator that is required to pay damages for breach of representation or \nwarranty can do so provided the agreement to pay damages meets the following \nconditions: \n*    the onus of proof for breach of representation or warranty remains at all times with the party so alleging; \n*    the party alleging the breach serves a written Notice of Claim on the originator , \nspecifying the basis for the claim; and \n*    damages are limited to losses directly incurred as a result of the breach. \n  185    \n(g)    An originator should notify RBI (Department of Banking Supervision) of all instances \nwhere it has agreed to replace assets sold to SPV or pay damages arising out of any \nrepresentation or warranty. \n10.        Re-purchase of Assets from SPVs  \nAn option to repurchase fully performing assets at the end of the securitisation scheme \nwhere residual value of such assets has, in aggregate, fallen to less than 10% of the \noriginal amount sold to the SPV (\"clean up calls\") could be retained by the originator and would not be construed to constitute 'effective control', provided: \n(i)    the purchase is conducted at arm's length, on market terms and conditions \n(including price / fee) and is subject to the originator's normal credit approval and \nreview processes; and \n(ii)    the exercise of the clean-up call is at its discretion. \n \nPOLICY ON PROVISION OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT FACILITIES\n11.        Detailed Policy  \nCredit enhancement facilities include all arrangem ents provided to the SPV that could result \nin a bank absorbing losses of the SPV or its investors. Such facilities may be provided by \nboth originators and third parties. A bank should hold capital against the credit risk assumed when it provides credit enhancement, either exp licitly or implicitly, to a special purpose \nvehicle or its investors. The entity providing credit enhancement facilities should ensure that the following conditions are fulfilled. Where any of the conditions is not satisfied, the bank providing credit enhancement facility will be required to hold capital against the full value of the securitised assets as if they were held on its balance sheet. \n11.1    Provision of the facility should be structured in a manner to keep it distinct from other \nfacilities and documented separately from any other facility provided by the bank. The \nnature, purpose, extent of the facility and all required standards of performance should be \nclearly specified in a written agreement to be executed at the time of originating the \ntransaction and disclosed in the offer document. \n11.2    The facility is provided on an 'arm's length basis' on market terms and conditions, and subjected to the facility provider\u2019s normal credit approval and review process. \n10.3    Payment of any fee or other income for the facility is not subordinated or subject to deferral or waiver. \n11.4    The facility is limited to a specified amount and duration. \n11.5    The duration of the facility is limited to the earlier of the dates on which: \n(i)    the underlying assets are redeemed; \n(ii)    all claims connected with the securities issued by the SPV are paid out; or \n(iii)    the bank's obligations are otherwise terminated. \n  186    \n11.6    There should not be any recourse to the facility provider beyond the fixed contractual \nobligations. In particular, the facility provi der should not bear any recurring expenses of the \nsecuritisation. \n11.7    The facility provider has written opinions from its legal advisors that the terms of agreement protect it from any liability to the investors in the securitisation or to the SPV / \ntrustee, except in relation to its contractual obligations pursuant to the agreement governing \nprovision of the facility. \n11.8    The SPV and / or investors in the securities issued by the SPV have the clear right to \nselect an alternative party to provide the facility. \n11.9    Credit enhancement facility should be provided only at the initiation of the securitisation transaction. \n11.10    The amount of credit enhancement extended at the initiation of the securitisation \ntransaction should be available to the SPV during the entire life of the securities issued by \nthe SPV. The amount of credit enhancement shall be reduced only to the extent of draw \ndowns to meet the contingencies arising out of losses accruing to the SPV or its investors. No portion of the credit enhancement shall be released to the provider during the life of the \nsecurities issued by the SPV. \n11.11    Any utilization / draw down of the credit enhancement should be immediately \nwritten-off by debit to the profit and loss account. \n11.12    When a first loss facility does not provide substantial cover a second loss facility \nmight carry a disproportionate share of risk. In order to limit this possibility, a credit \nenhancement facility will be deemed to be a second loss facility only where: \n*    it enjoys protection given by  a substantial first loss facility; \n*    it can be drawn on only after the first loss facility has been completely \nexhausted; \n*    it covers only losses beyond those covered by the first loss facility; and \n*    the provider of the first loss facility continues to meet its obligations. \nIf the second loss facility does not meet the above criteria, it will be treated as a first loss facility. \n11.13    The first-loss facility would be considered substantial where it covers some multiple \nof historic losses or worst case losses estimated by simulation or other techniques. The \nsecond loss facility provider shall assess adequacy of first loss facility on an arm\u2019s length \nbasis and shall review it periodically at least once in six months. The following factors may \nbe reckoned while conducting the assessment as well as review: \n(i)    the class and quality of assets held by the SPV; \n(ii)    the history of default rates on the assets; \n(iii)    the output of any statistical models used by banks to assess expected \ndefault rates on the assets; \n(iv)    the types of activity in which the SPV is engaging in or is permitted to engage in; \n(v)    the quality of the parties providing the first loss facility; and \n  187    \n(vi)    the opinions or rating letters provided by reputable rating agencies \nregarding the adequacy of first loss protection. \n \n12  and 13 : Replaced by para 5.16.2  of this circular.  \n \nPOLICY ON PROVISION OF LIQUIDITY FACILITIES\n14.        Detailed Policy on provision of liquidity support  \nA liquidity facility is provided to help smoothen the timing differences faced by the SPV \nbetween the receipt of cash flows from the underlying assets and the payments to be made \nto investors. A liquidity facility should meet the following conditions to guard against the \npossibility of the facility functioning as a form of credit enhancement and / or credit support. In case the facility fails to meet any of these conditions, it will be regarded as serving the \neconomic purpose of credit enhancement and the liqui dity facility provided by a third party \nshall be treated as a first loss facility and the liquidity facility provided by the originator shall \nbe treated as a second loss facility. \n14.1    All conditions specified in paragraphs 11.1 to 11.8 above. \n14.2    The securitised assets are covered by a substantial first loss credit enhancement. \n14.3    The documentation for the facility must clearly define the circumstances under which \nthe facility may or may not be drawn on. \n14.4    The facility should be capable of being drawn only where there is a sufficient level of non-defaulted assets to cover drawings, or the full amount of assets that may turn non-performing are covered by a substantial credit enhancement. \n14.5    The facility shall not be drawn for the purpose of \n(a)    providing credit enhancement; \n(b)    covering losses of the SPV; \n(c)    serving as a permanent revolving funding; and \n(d)    covering any losses incurred in the underlying pool of exposures prior to a \ndraw down. \n14.6    The liquidity facility should not be available for (a) meeting recurring expenses of \nsecuritisation; (b) funding acquisition of additional assets by the SPV; (c) funding the final \nscheduled repayment of investors and (d) funding breach of warranties. \n14.7    Funding should be provided to SPV and not directly to the investors. \n14.8    When the liquidity facility has been drawn the facility provider shall have a priority of \nclaim over the future cash flows from the underlying assets, which will be senior to the claims of the senior most investor. \n14.9    When the originator is providing the liquidity facility, an independent third party, other than the originator's group entities, should co-provi de at least 25% of the liquidity facility that \nshall be drawn and repaid on a pro-rata basis. The originator must not be liable to meet any \n  188    \nshortfall in liquidity support provided by the independent party. During the initial phase, a \nbank may provide the full amount of a liquidity facility on the basis that it will find an independent party to participate in the facility as provided above. The originator will have three months to locate such independent third party. \n15.        Treatment of liquidity facility  \n15.1    The commitment to provide liquidity facility, to the extent not drawn would be an off- \nbalance sheet item and attract 100% credit conversion factor as well as 100 % risk weight. \nThe extent to which the commitment becomes a funded facility, it would attract 100 % risk \nweight. \n15.2    Since the liquidity facility is meant to smoothen temporary cash flow mismatches, the \nfacility will remain drawn only for short periods. If the drawings under the facility are \noutstanding for more than 90 days it should be classified as NPA and fully provided for. \n \nPOLICY ON PROVISION OF UNDERWRITING FACILITIES\n16.        General Policy  \nAn originator or a third-party service provider may act as an underwriter for the issue of \nsecurities by SPV and treat the facility as  an underwriting facility for capital adequacy \npurposes subject to the following conditions. In case any of the conditions is not satisfied, \nthe facility will be considered as a credit enhancement and treated as a first loss facility when provided by a third party and a second lo ss facility when provided by an originator. \n16.1    All conditions specified in paragraphs 11.1 to 11.8 above. \n16.2    The underwriting is exercisable only w hen the SPV cannot issue securities into the \nmarket at a price equal to or above the benchmark predetermined in the underwriting \nagreement. \n16.3    The bank has the ability to withhold payment and to terminate the facility, if \nnecessary, upon the occurrence of specified events(e.g. material adverse changes or \ndefaults on assets above a specified level); and \n16.4    There is a market for the type of securities underwritten. \n \n17.  Underwriting  \n17.1    Underwriting by an originator\nAn originator may underwrite only investment grade senior securities issued by the SPV. \nThe holdings of securities devolved through underwriting should be sold to third parties \nwithin three-month period following the acquisition. During the stipulated time limit, the total \noutstanding amount of devolved securities will be  subjected to a risk weight of 100 per cent. \nIn case of failure to off-load within the stipulated time limit, any holding in excess of 10 per \ncent of the original amount of issue, including secondary market purchases, shall be \ndeducted 50% from Tier I capital and 50% from Tier II capital. \n17.2    Underwriting by third party service providers\nA third party service provider may underwrit e the securities issued by the SPV. The \nholdings of securities devolved through underwriting should be sold to third parties within \n  189    \nthree-month period following the acquisition. During the stipulated time limit, the total \noutstanding amount of devolved securities will be  subjected to a risk weight of 100 per cent. \nIn case of failure to off-load within the stipulated time limit, the total outstanding amount of \ndevolved securities which are at least invest ment grade will attract a 100% risk weight and \nthose which are below investment grade will be deducted from capital at 50% from Tier I \nand 50% from Tier II. \nPOLICY ON PROVISION OF SERVICES\n18.        A servicing bank administers or se rvices the securitised assets. Hence, it should \nnot have any reputational obligation to support any losses incurred by the SPV and should \nbe able to demonstrate this to the investors. A bank performing the role of a service \nprovider for a proprietary or a third-party se curitisation transaction should ensure that the \nfollowing conditions are fulfilled. Where the following conditions are not met, the service \nprovider may be deemed as providing liquidity facility to the SPV or investors and treated accordingly for capital adequacy purpose. \n18.1    All conditions specified in paragraphs 11.1 to 11.8 above. \n18.2    The service provider should be under no obligation to remit funds to the SPV or \ninvestors until it has received funds generated from the underlying assets except where it is the provider of an eligible liquidity facility. \n18.3    The service provider shall hold in trust, on behalf of the investors, the cash flows \narising from the underlying and should avoid co-m ingling of these cash flows with their own \ncash flows. \n \n19.       PRUDENTIAL NORMS FOR INVESTMENT IN THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY SPV  \n19.1    As the securities issued by SPVs would be in the nature of non-SLR securities, banks' investment in these securities would attract all prudential norms applicable to non-\nSLR investments prescribed by RBI from time to time \n19.2    Limits on investment in securities by the originator\nThe aggregate investment by the originator in securities issued by SPV would be as given \nin para 7.13. \n19.3    Exposure norms for investment in the PTCs\nThe counterparty for the investor in the securities would not be the SPV but the underlying assets in respect of which the cash flows are expected from the obligors / borrowers. These \nshould be taken into consideration when reck oning overall exposures to any particular \nborrower / borrower Group, industry or geographic area for the purpose of managing \nconcentration risks and compliance with extant prudential exposure norms, wherever the \nobligors in the pool constitute 5% or more of the receivables in the pool or Rs.5 crore, \nwhichever is lower. \n \n19.4    Income recognition and provisioning norms for investors in the PTCs\nAs the securities are expected to be limited-tenor, interest bearing debt instruments, the \nincome on the securities may normally be recognised on accrual basis. However, if the \nincome (or even the redemption amount) on securities remains in arrears for more than 90 \n  190    \ndays, any future income should be recognised only on realisation and any unrealised \nincome recognised on accrual basis should be reversed. In case of pendency of dues on the securities appropriate provisions for the diminution in value of the securities on account \nof such overdues should also be made, as al ready envisaged in the extant RBI norms for \nclassification and valuation of investment by the banks. \n \n20.        ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE SECURITISATION TRANSACTIONS  \n20.1    Accounting in the books of the originator\nIn terms of these guidelines bank s can sell assets to SPV only  on cash basis and the sale \nconsideration should be received not later than the transfer of the asset to the SPV. Hence, \nany loss arising on account of the sale should be accounted accordingly and reflected in the \nProfit & Loss account for the period during which the sale is effected and any profit / \npremium arising on account of sale should be amortised over the life of the securities issued \nor to be issued by the SPV. \n(i)    In case the securitised assets qualify for derecognition from the books of the \noriginator, the entire expenses incurred on the transaction, say, legal fees, etc., should be expensed at the time of the transaction and should not be deferred. \n(ii)    Where the securitised assets do not qualify for derecognition the sale consideration received shall be treated as a borrowing. \n20.2    The accounting treatment of the securitisation transactions in the books of \noriginators, SPV and investors in securities will be as per the guidance note issued by the \nICAI with reference to those aspects not specifically covered in these guidelines. \u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  191    \n \n \n ANNEX - 8 \n(Cf.

Para 8.3.10) \n \nMeasurement of capital charge for market risks in respect of  \ninterest rate derivatives and options  \n \nA. Interest rate derivatives  \nThe measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off-balance-sheet \ninstruments in the trading book, which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. forward rate \nagreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate and cross-currency swaps and forward foreign exchange positions). Options can be treated in a variety of ways as described in para B.1 below. A summary of the rules for dealing with interest rate \nderivatives is set out in the Table at the end of this section.  \n1. Calculation of positions \nThe derivatives should be converted into pos itions in the relevant underlying and be \nsubjected to specific and general market risk charges as described in the guidelines. In \norder to calculate the capital charge, the amounts reported should be the market value of \nthe principal amount of the underlying or of the notional underlying. For instruments where \nthe apparent notional amount differs from the effective notional amount, banks must use the \neffective notional amount.  \n(a) Futures and forward contracts, including forward rate agreements \nThese instruments are treated as a combination of a long and a short position in a notional \ngovernment security. The maturity of a future or a FRA will be the period until delivery or exercise of the contract, plus - where applicable - the life of the underlying instrument. For \nexample, a long position in a June three-month interest rate future (taken in April) is to be \nreported as a long position in a government security with a maturity of five months and a \nshort position in a government security with a maturity of two months.  Where a range of \ndeliverable instruments may be delivered to fulfill the contract, the bank has flexibility to \nelect which deliverable security goes into the duration ladder but should take account of any conversion factor defined by the exchange.  \n(b) Swaps \nSwaps will be treated as two notional positions in government securities with relevant \nmaturities. For example, an interest rate swap under which a bank is receiving floating rate \ninterest and paying fixed will be treated as a long position in a floating rate instrument of \nmaturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-\n  197    \nrate instrument of maturity equivalent to the residual life of the swap.  For swaps that pay or \nreceive a fixed or floating interest rate against some other reference price, e.g. a stock \nindex, the interest rate component should be slotted into the appropriate repricing maturity \ncategory, with the equity component being included in the equity framework.  \nSeparate legs of cross-currency swaps are to be reported in the relevant maturity ladders \nfor the currencies concerned. \n2.  Calculation of capital charges for derivatives under the standardised \nmethodology \n(a) Allowable offsetting of matched positions \nBanks may exclude the following from the interest rate maturity framework altogether (for \nboth specific and general market risk);  \n\u2022 Long and short positions (both actual and notional) in identical instruments with \nexactly the same issuer, coupon, currency and maturity.  \n\u2022 A matched position in a future or forward and its corresponding underlying may also \nbe fully offset, (the leg representing the time to expiry of the future should however \nbe reported) and thus excluded from the calculation.  \nWhen the future or the forward comprises a range of deliverable instruments, offsetting of \npositions in the future or forward contract and its underlying is only permissible in cases \nwhere there is a readily identifiable underlying se curity which is most profitable for the trader \nwith a short position to deliver. The price of this security, sometimes called the \"cheapest-to-\ndeliver\", and the price of the future or forward contract should in such cases move in close \nalignment.  \nNo offsetting will be allowed between positions in different currencies; the separate legs of \ncross-currency swaps or forward foreign exchange deals are to be treated as notional \npositions in the relevant instruments and included in the appropriate calculation for each currency. \nIn addition, opposite positions in the same category of instruments can in certain \ncircumstances be regarded as matched and allowed to offset fully. To qualify for this \ntreatment the positions must relate to the same underlying instruments, be of the same nominal value and be denominated in the same currency. In addition: \n\u2022 for futures : offsetting positions in the notional or underlying instruments to which the \nfutures contract relates must be for identical products and mature within seven days of each other; \n  198    \n\u2022 for swaps and FRAs : the reference rate (for floating rate positions) must be identical \nand the coupon closely matched (i.e. within 15 basis points); and \n\u2022 for swaps, FRAs and forwards : the next interest fixing date or, for fixed coupon \npositions or forwards, the residual maturity must correspond within the following \nlimits: \no less than one month hence: same day; \no between one month and one year hence: within seven days; \no over one year hence: within thirty days. \nBanks with large swap books may use alternative formulae for these swaps to calculate the \npositions to be included in the duration ladder. The method would be to calculate the \nsensitivity of the net present value implied by the change in yield used in the duration \nmethod and allocate these sensitivities into the time-bands set out in Table  17 in \nparagraph 8.3 of this Master Circular. \n(b) Specific risk \nInterest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest \nrate futures will not be subject to a specific  risk charge. This exemption also applies to \nfutures on an interest rate index (e.g. LIBOR). However, in the case of futures contracts \nwhere the underlying is a debt security, or an index representing a basket of debt securities, a specific risk charge will apply according to the credit risk of the issuer as set out in \nparagraphs above. \n(c) General market risk \nGeneral market risk applies to positions in all derivative products in the same manner as for \ncash positions, subject only to an exemption for fully or very closely matched positions in \nidentical instruments as defined in paragraphs above. The various categories of instruments should be slotted into the maturity ladder and treated according to the rules identified earlier. \n \n \n \n \n \n  199    \nTable - Summary of treatment of interest rate derivatives \nInstrument Specific \nrisk \ncharge General Market risk \ncharge \nExchange-traded future \n- Government debt security \n- Corporate debt security \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR) \n  \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions \nOTC  forward \n- Government debt security \n- Corporate debt security \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR) \n  \nNo \nYes \nNo  \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions \nYes, as two positions \nFRAs, Swaps No Yes, as two positions \nForward Foreign Exchange No Yes, as one position in \neach currency \nOptions \n- Government debt security \n- Corporate debt security \n- Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR) \n- FRAs, Swaps  \nNo \nYes \nNo \nNo  \n \nB. Treatment of Options  \n1. In recognition of the wide diversity of banks\u2019 activities in options and the difficulties of \nmeasuring price risk for options, alternative approaches are permissible as under: \n\u2022 those banks which solely use purchased options54 will be free to use the simplified \napproach described in Section I below; \n\u2022 those banks which also write options will be expected to use one of the intermediate \napproaches as set out in Section II below. \n2. In the simplified approach , the positions for the options and the associated underlying, \ncash or forward, are not subject to the standardised methodology but rather are \"carved-out\" and subject to separately calculated capital charges that incorporate both general \nmarket risk and specific risk. The risk numbers thus generated are then added to the capital \ncharges for the relevant category, i.e. interest rate related instruments, equities, and foreign exchange as described in Paragraph 8.3 to 8.5 of this Master Circular. The delta-plus \nmethod uses the sensitivity parameters or \"Greek letters\" associated with options to \nmeasure their market risk and capital requirements. Under this method, the delta-equivalent \n                                            \n54 Unless all their written option positions are hedged by perfectly matched long positions in exactly \nthe same options, in which case no capital charge for market risk is required \n  200    \nposition of each option becomes part of the standardised methodology set out in Paragraph \n8.3 to 8.5 of this Master Circular with the delta-equivalent amount subject to the applicable general market risk charges. Separate capital charges are then applied to the gamma and \nVega risks of the option positions. The scenario approach uses simulation techniques to \ncalculate changes in the value of an options portfolio for changes in the level and volatility of \nits associated underlyings. Under this approach, the general market risk charge is determined by the scenario \"grid\" (i.e. the specified combination of underlying and volatility \nchanges) that produces the largest loss. For the delta-plus method and the scenario \napproach the specific risk capital charges are determined separately by multiplying the delta-equivalent of each option by the specific risk weights set out in Paragraph 8.3 to 8.4 of this Master Circular. \nI. Simplified approach \n3.  Banks which handle a limited range of purchased options only will be free to use the \nsimplified approach set out in Table A below, for particular trades. As an example of how \nthe calculation would work, if a holder of 100 shares currently valued at Rs.10 each holds \nan equivalent put option with a strike price of Rs.11, the capital charge would be: Rs.1,000 x \n18 per cent (i.e. 9 per cent specific plus 9 per cent general market risk) = Rs.180, less the \namount the option is in the money (Rs.11 \u2013 Rs.10) x 100 = Rs.100, i.e. the capital charge \nwould be Rs.80. A similar methodology applies for options whose underlying is a foreign \ncurrency or an interest rate related instrument.  \nTable A - Simplified approach: capital charges \n \nPosition Treatment \nLong cash and Long put \nOr \nShort cash and Long call  The capital charge will be the market value of the \nunderlying security55  multiplied by the sum of specific \nand general market risk charges56 for the underlying \nless the amount the option is in the money (if any) \nbounded at zero57  \n \n                                            \n55 In some cases such as foreign exchange, it ma y be unclear which side is the \"underlying security\"; \nthis should be taken to be the asset which would be received if the option were exercised. In addition \nthe nominal value should be used for items where the market value of the underlying instrument \ncould be zero, e.g. caps and floors, swaptions etc. \n \n56 Some options (e.g. where the underlying is an interest ra te or a currency) bear no specific risk, but specific \nrisk will be present in the case of opti ons on certain interest rate-related in struments (e.g. options on a corporate \ndebt security or corporate bond index; see Section B for the relevant capital charges) and for options on equities \nand stock indices (see Section C). The charge under this  measure for currency options will be 9 per cent.  \n \n57 For options with a residual maturity of more than six months, the strike price should be compared with the \nforward, not current, price. A bank unable to do this  must take the \"in-the-money\" amount to be zero. \n \n  201    \nLong call \nOr \nLong put The capital charge will be the lesser of: \n(i) the market value of the underlying security \nmultiplied by the sum of specific and general market \nrisk charges3 for the underlying  \n(ii) the market value of the option58\n \nII. Intermediate approaches \n(a) Delta-plus method \n4.     Banks which write options will be allowed to include delta-weighted options positions \nwithin the standardised methodology set out in paragraph 8.3 to 8.5 of this Master Circular. Such options should be reported as a position equal to the market value of the underlying \nmultiplied by the delta. \nHowever, since delta does not sufficiently cover the risks associated with options positions, \nbanks will also be required to measure gamma (which measures the rate of change of \ndelta) and Vega (which measures the sensitivity of the value of an option with respect to a change in volatility) sensitivities in order to calculate the total capital charge. These sensitivities will be calculated according to an approved exchange model or to the bank\u2019s \nproprietary options pricing model subject to  oversight by the Reserve Bank of India\n59. \n5. Delta-weighted positions with debt securities or interest rates as the underlying will be \nslotted into the interest rate time-bands, as set out in Table 17  of paragraph 8.3 of this \nMaster Circular , under the following procedure. A two-legged approach should be used as \nfor other derivatives, requiring one entry at the time the underlying contract takes effect and \na second at the time the underlying contract matures. For instance, a bought call option on \na June three-month interest-rate future will in April be considered, on the basis of its delta-equivalent value, to be a long position with a maturity of five months and a short position with a maturity of two months\n60. The written option will be similarly slotted as a long position \nwith a maturity of two months and a short position with a maturity of five months. Floating rate instruments with caps or floors will be treated as a combination of floating rate securities and a series of European-style options. For example, the holder of a three-year floating rate bond indexed to six month LIBOR with a cap of 15 per cent will treat it as: \n                                            \n58 Where the position does not fall within the trading book (i.e. options on certain foreign exchange or \ncommodities positions not belonging to the trading book),  it may be acceptable to use the book value instead. \n 59 Reserve Bank of India may wish to require banks doi ng business in certain classes of exotic options (e.g. \nbarriers, digitals) or in options \"at-the-money\" that are close to expiry to use either the scenario approach or the \ninternal models alternative, both of which c an accommodate more detailed revaluation approaches. \n \n60 Two-months call option on a bond future, where deliv ery of the bond takes place in September, would be \nconsidered in April as being long the bond and short a five-month deposit, both posit ions being delta-weighted. \n  202    \n(i) a debt security that reprices in six months; and \n(ii) a series of five written call options on a FRA with a reference rate of 15 per cent, \neach with a negative sign at the time the underlying FRA takes effect and a positive \nsign at the time the underlying FRA matures61. \n6.       The capital charge for options with equities as the underlying will also be based on \nthe delta-weighted positions which will be incorporated in the measure of market risk described in paragraph 8.4 of this Master Circular.  For purposes of this calculation each \nnational market is to be treated as a separate underlying. The capital charge for options on \nforeign exchange and gold positions will be based on the method set out in paragraph 8.5 of \nthis Master Circular.  For delta risk, the net delta-based equivalent of the foreign currency \nand gold options will be incorporated into the measurement of the exposure for the respective currency (or gold) position.  \n7.      In addition to the above capital charges arising from delta risk, there will be further \ncapital charges for gamma and for Vega risk. Banks using the delta-plus method will be \nrequired to calculate the gamma and Vega for each option position (including hedge \npositions) separately. The capital charges should be calculated in the following way: \n(i) for each individual option a \"gamma impact\" should be calculated according to \na Taylor series expansion as: \nGamma impact = \u00bd x Gamma x VU\u00b2 \nwhere VU = Variation of the underlying of the option. \n(ii) VU will be calculated as follows: \n\u2022 for interest rate options if the underlying is a bond, the price sensitivity should \nbe worked out as explained. An equivalent calculation should be carried out \nwhere the underlying is an interest rate.  \n\u2022 for options on equities and equity indices; which are not permitted at present, \nthe market value of the underlying should be multiplied by 9 per cent62; \n\u2022 for foreign exchange and gold options: the market value of the underlying \nshould be multiplied by 9 per cent; \n(iii) For the purpose of this calculation the following positions should be treated as \nthe same underlyin g: \n                                            \n61 The rules applying to closely-matched positions set out in  paragraph 2 (a) of this Appendix will also apply in \nthis respect. \n62 The basic rules set out here for interest rate and equi ty options do not attempt to capture specific risk when \ncalculating gamma capital charges. However, Reserve Bank may require specific banks to do so. \n \n  203    \n\u2022 for interest rates,63 each time-band as set out in Table 17 of the guidelines;64 \n\u2022 for equities and stock indices, each national market; \n\u2022 for foreign currencies and gold, each currency pair and gold; \n(iv)  Each option on the same underlying will have a gamma impact that is either \npositive or negative. These individual gamma impacts will be summed, resulting in a \nnet gamma impact for each underlying that is  either positive or negative. Only those \nnet gamma impacts that are negative will be included in the capital calculation.  \n(v) The total gamma capital charge will be the sum of the absolute value of the net  negative gamma impacts as calculated above. \n(vi) For volatility risk,  banks will be required to calculate the capital charges by \nmultiplying the sum of the Vegas for all options on the same underlying, as defined \nabove, by a proportional shift in volatility of \u00b1\uf02025 per cent. \n(vii) The total capital charge for Vega risk will be the sum of the absolute value of \nthe individual capital charges that have been calculated for Vega risk. \n(b)   Scenario approach \n8.    More sophisticated banks will also have the right to base the market risk capital charge \nfor options portfolios and associated hedging positions on scenario matrix analysi s. This will \nbe accomplished by specifying a fixed range of changes in the option portfolio\u2019s risk factors \nand calculating changes in the value of the option portfolio at various points along this \n\"grid\". For the purpose of calculating the capital charge, the bank will revalue the option portfolio using matrices for simultaneous changes in the option\u2019s underlying rate or price and in the volatility of that rate or price. A different matrix will be set up for each individual \nunderlying as defined in paragraph 7 above. As an alternative, at the discretion of each \nnational authority, banks which are significant trader s in options for interest rate options will \nbe permitted to base the calculation on a minimum of six sets of time-bands. When using this method, not more than three of the time-bands as defined in paragraph 8.3 of this Master Circular should be combined into any one set. \n9.     The options and related hedging positions will be evaluated over a specified range \nabove and below the current value of the underlying. The range for interest rates is consistent with the assumed changes in yield in Table - 17 of paragraph 8.3 of this Master \n                                            \n63 Positions have to be slotted into separate maturity ladders by currency. \n \n64 Banks using the duration method should use the time-bands as set out in Table 18 of the guidelines. \n  204    \nCircular.   Those banks using the alternative method for interest rate options set out in \nparagraph 8 above should use, for each set of time-bands, the highest of the assumed changes in yield applicable to the group to which the time-bands belong.\n65 The other ranges \nare \u00b19  per cent for equities and \u00b19  per cent for foreign exchange and gold. For all risk \ncategories, at least seven observations (including the current observation) should be used to divide the range into equally spaced intervals. \n10.    The second dimension of the matrix entails a change in the volatility of the underlying \nrate or price. A single change in the volatility of the underlying rate or price equal to a shift in \nvolatility of + 25 per cent and - 25 per cent is expected to be sufficient in most cases. As circumstances warrant, however, the Reserve Bank may choose to require that a different change in volatility be used and / or that intermediate points on the grid be calculated. \n11.     After calculating the matrix, each cell contains the net profit or loss of the option and \nthe underlying hedge instrument. The capital charge for each underlying will then be \ncalculated as the largest loss contained in the matrix. \n12.     In drawing up these intermediate approaches it has been sought to cover the major \nrisks associated with options. In doing so, it is conscious that so far as specific risk is \nconcerned, only the delta-related elements are captured; to capture other risks would \nnecessitate a much more complex regime. On the other hand, in other areas the simplifying assumptions used have resulted in a relatively conservative treatment of certain options \npositions.  \n13.     Besides the options risks mentioned above, the  RBI is conscious of the other risks \nalso associated with options, e.g. rho (rate of change of the value of the option with respect \nto the interest rate) and theta (rate of change of the value of the option with respect to time). While not proposing a measurement system for those risks at present, it expects banks undertaking significant options business at the very least to monitor such risks closely. \nAdditionally, banks will be permitted to incorporate rho into their capital calculations for \ninterest rate risk, if they wish to do so. \n \n \n \n                                            \n65 If, for example, the time-bands 3 to 4 years, 4 to 5 years and 5 to 7 ye ars are combined, t he highest assumed \nchange in yield of these th ree bands would be 0.75. \n \n  205    \n                                           ANNEX -  10 \n                    (Cf. Para 13.5 ) \n \nAn Illustrative Approach for Measurement of  \nInterest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) under Pillar II  \n \nThe Basel-II Framework (Paras 739 and 762 to 764) require the banks to measure the \ninterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and hold capital commensurate with it. If supervisors determine that banks are not holding capital commensurate with the level of \ninterest rate risk, they must require the bank to reduce its risk, to hold a specific additional \namount of capital or some combination of the two. To comply with the requirements of Pillar \nII relating to IRRBB, the guidelines on Pillar II issued by many regulators contain definite \nprovisions indicating the approach adopted by the supervisors to assess the level of interest rate risk in the banking book and the action to be taken in case the level of interest rate risk found is significant.  \nIn terms of para 764 of the Basel II framework, the banks can follow the indicative \nmethodology prescribed in the supporting document \"Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest Rate Risk\" issued by BCBS for assessment of sufficiency of capital \nfor IRRBB. \n \n2.  The approach prescribed in the BCBS Paper on \u201cPrinciples for the                                                \nManagement and Supervision of Interest Rate Risk\"  \nThe main components of the approach prescribed in the above mentioned supporting \ndocument are as under: \na) The assessment should take into account both the earnings perspective and \neconomic value perspective of interest rate risk. \n \nb) The impact on income or the economic value of equity should be calculated by \napplying a notional interest rate shock of 200 basis points. \n \nc) The usual methods followed in measuring the interest rate risk are : \n \na) Earnings perspective \nGap Analysis, simulation techniques and Internal Models based on VaR \n \nb) Economic perspective \nGap analysis combined with duration gap analysis, simulation techniques \nand Internal Models based on VaR  \n \n3. Methods for measurement of the IRRBB  \n 3.1 Impact on Earnings  \nThe major methods used for computing the impact on earnings are the gap Analysis, \nSimulations and VaR based Techniques. Banks in India have been using the Gap Reports to assess the impact of adverse movements in the interest rate on income through gap \n  206    \nmethod. The banks may continue with the same. However, the banks may use the \nsimulations also. The banks may calculate the impact on the earnings by gap analysis or any other method with the assumed change in yield on 200 bps over one year. However, no \ncapital needs to be allocated for the impact on the earnings.    \n3.2 Impact of IRRBB on the Market Value of Equity (MVE)  \nThe banks may use the Method indicated in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \n(BCBS) Paper \"Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest rate Risk\" (July \n2004) for computing the impact of the interest rate shock on the MVE. \n \n3.2.1 Method indicated in the BCBS Paper on \"Principles for the                                                \nManagement and Supervision of Interest Rate Risk\"  \nThe following steps are involved in this approach:  \na) The variables such as maturity/re-pricing date, coupon rate, frequency, \nprincipal amount for each item of asset/liability (for each category of asset / \nliability) are generated. \n \nb) The longs and shorts in each time band are offset.  \n \nc) The resulting short and long positions are weighted by a factor that is \ndesigned to reflect the sensitivity of the positions in the different time bands to an assumed change in interest rates. These factors are based on an \nassumed parallel shift of 200 basis points throughout the time spectrum, and \non a proxy of modified duration of positions situated at the middle of each \ntime band and yielding 5 per cent. \n \nd) The resulting weighted positions are summed up, offsetting longs and shorts, \nleading to the net short- or long-weighted position.  \n \ne) The weighted position is seen in relation to capital.  \n \nFor details banks may refer to the captioned paper issued by BCBS. For the sake of \nconvenience, Annex 4 and 5 of the Paper containing the framework and an example of the standardised framework are reproduced in Annex 11 and Annex 12.  \n \n3.2.2 Other techniques for Interest rate risk measurement  \nThe banks can also follow different versions / variations of the above techniques or entirely different techniques to measure the IRRBB if they find them conceptually sound. In this context, Annex 2 and 3 of the BCBS paper referred to above provide broad details of \ninterest rate risk measurement techniques and overview of some of the factors which the \nsupervisory authorities might consider in obtaining and analysing the information on individual bank\u2019s exposures to interest rate risk. These Annexes are reproduced in Annex \n13 and Annex 14 , respectively.  \n \n  207    \n4. Suggested approach for measuring the impact of IRRBB on capital   \n4.1 As per Basel II Framework, if   the supervisor feels that the bank is not holding \ncapital commensurate with the level of IRRBB, it may either require the bank to reduce the \nrisk or allocate additional capital or a combination of the two.  \n4.2 The banks can decide, with the approval of the Board, on the appropriate level of \ninterest rate risk in the banking book which they would like to carry keeping in view their \ncapital level, interest rate management skills and the ability to re-balance the banking book \nportfolios quickly in case of adverse movement in the interest rates. In any case, a level of \ninterest rate risk which generates a drop in the MVE of more than 20 per cent with an interest rate shock of 200 basis points, will be treated as excessive and such banks would normally be required by the RBI to hold additional capital against IRRBB as determined during the SREP. The banks which have IRRBB exposure equivalent to less than 20 per \ncent drop in the MVE may also be required to hold additional capital if the level of interest \nrate risk is considered, by the RBI, to be high in relation to their capital level or the quality of interest rate risk management framework obtaining in the bank. While the banks may on their own decide to hold additional capital towards IRRBB keeping in view the potential drop \nin their MVE, the IRR management skills and the ability to re-balance the portfolios quickly \nin case of adverse movement in the interest rates, the amount of exact capital add-on, if considered necessary, will be decided by the RBI as part of the SREP, in consultation with the bank.  \n5. Limit setting  \nThe banks would be well advised to consider setting the internal limits for controlling their \nIRRBB. The following are some of the indicative ways for setting the limits: \n \na) Internal limits could be fixed in terms of the maximum decline in earnings (as \na percentage of the base-scenario income) or decline in capital (as a \npercentage of the base-scenario capital position) as a result of 200 or 300 \nbasis point interest-rate shock. \n \nb) The limits could also be placed in terms of PV01 value (present value of a \nbasis point) of the net position of the bank as a percentage of net \nworth/capital of the bank.      \n \n \n \n \n  208    \n \nANNEX - 11 \n(Cf. Para 3.2.1 of Annex  10)  \n \nAnnex 3 to the BCBS Paper on Principles for \nManagement and Supervision of IRR, July 2004  \n \nThe Standardised Interest Rate Shock  \n1. To facilitate supervisors\u2019 monitoring of interest rate risk exposures across \ninstitutions, banks would have to provide the resu lts of their internal measurement systems, \nexpressed in terms of the change in economic value relative to capital, using a standardised \ninterest rate shock. This annex gives the technical background to the selection of the \nstandardised rate shock. In selecting the shock, the following guiding principles were followed: \n\u2022 The rate shock should reflect a fairly uncommon and stressful rate environment; \n \n\u2022 The magnitude of the rate shock should be significant enough to capture the effects \nof embedded options and convexity within bank assets and liabilities so that \nunderlying risk may be revealed; \n \n\u2022 The rate shock should be straightforward and practical to implement, and should be \nable to accommodate the diverse approaches inherent in single-rate-path simulation models and statistically driven value-at-risk models for banking book positions; \n \n\u2022 The underlying methodology should provi de relevant shocks for both G10 and \nmaterial non-G10 currency exposures; and \n \n\u2022 The underlying methodology should be adaptable for those non-G10 supervisors \nwho wish to implement this approach in their own countries. \n \n2.  With these principles in mind, the proposed rate shock should in principle be \ndetermined by banks, based on the following: \n\u2022 For exposures in G10 currencies, either: \n(a) An upward and downward 200 basis point parallel rate shock; or \n(b)  1st and 99th percentile of observed interest rate changes using a \none-year (240 working days) holding period and a minimum five \nyears of observations. \n\u2022 For exposures in non-G10 currencies, either: \n(a) A parallel rate shock substantially consistent with 1st and 99th \npercentile of observed interest rate changes using a one-year (240 \nworking days) holding period and a minimum five years of \nobservations for the particular non-G10 currency; or \n(b)  1st and 99th percentile of observed interest rate changes using a \none-year (240 working days) holding period and a minimum five \nyears of observations. \n \n  209    \n3.  In considering potential rate shocks, historical rate changes among a number of \nG10 countries were analysed. A one-year holding period (240 business days) was selected both for practical purposes and in recognition that within a one-year period most institutions \nhave the ability to restructure or hedge their positions to mitigate further losses in economic \nvalue should rates appear to be exceptionally volatile. Five years worth of rate change observations require a minimum of six years of historical data to calculate rate differences for a one-year holding period on a rolling basis. For  example, the first observation from five \nyears ago must look back to the rate environment six years ago to calculate the first rate change. \n \n4.  A five-year historical observation period (six years of data) was thought to be long \nenough to capture more recent and relevant interest rate cycles. That time period also appears to offer a reasonably manageable set of data for institutions that wish to \nincorporate such data into their statistically driven value-at-risk models or in their own \nevaluations of a suitable parallel rate shock for non-G10 currencies. In defining uncommon \nand stressful scenarios, rate shocks of a magnitude that would not be expected to be exceeded with a 99 percent confidence interval were considered adequate. \n \n5.  In evaluating the data for G10 shocks, rate moves at the 1st and 99th percentile \nwere roughly comparable across most currencies, especially for longer maturities. A 200 \nbasis point up and down rate shock appears to adequately cover volatilities across G10 \ncurrencies. The appropriateness of the proposed shock will need to be monitored on an ongoing basis, and recalibrated should the rate environment shift materially. Importantly, by \ncalibrating the parallel shock to be roughly consistent with shocks that would be \nimplemented through more sophisticated, statistically driven approaches using standard \nparameters (99 percent confidence interval, one-year holding period, five years of observations), this approach does not foreclose the use of more innovative risk measurement systems. It also allows institut ions to use these parameters for calculating \nappropriate shocks themselves when they have material exposures outside G10 countries \nand for supervisors in emerging market and other non-G10 countries to derive simple shocks that are appropriate for their own countries. \n \n6. The analysis so far has implicitly assumed that  banks only carry interest rate risk in their \nhome currency. However, many banks will be exposed to interest rate risk in more than one \ncurrency. In such cases, banks should carry out a similar analysis for each currency \naccounting for 5 per cent or more of either their banking book assets or liabilities, using an \ninterest rate shock calculated according to one of the methodologies set out above. To ensure complete coverage of the banking book, remaining exposures should be aggregated \n  210    \nand subjected to a 200 basis point shock. \n7. The relative simplicity of a 200 basis point parallel rate shock has the disadvantage of \nignoring exposures that might be revealed through scenarios that include yield curve twists, \ninversions, and other relevant scenarios. Such alternative scenarios are a necessary \ncomponent of the overall management of interest rate risk as noted elsewhere in this paper. Supervisors will continue to expect institutions to perform multiple scenarios in evaluating \ntheir interest rate risk as appropriate to the level and nature of risk they are taking.  \n \n8. While more nuanced rate scenarios might tease out certain underlying risk \ncharacteristics, for the more modest objectives of supervisors in detecting institutions with \nsignificant levels of interest rate risk, a simple parallel shock is adequate. Such an approach \nalso recognises the potential for spurious precision that occurs when undue attention to fine \ndetail is placed on one aspect of a measurement system without recognition that \nassumptions employed for certain asset and liability categories, such as core deposits, are \nby necessity blunt and judgmental. Such judgmental aspects of an interest rate risk model \noften drive the resulting risk measure and conclusion, regardless of the detailed attention paid to other aspects of the risk measure. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n  211    \n \nANNEX - 12 \n (Cf. Para 3.2.1 of Annex 10) \n \nAnnex 4 to the BCBS Paper on Principles for  \nManagement and Supervision of IRR, July 2004  \n \nAn Example of a Standardised Framework  \n1. This annex contains an example setting out the methodology and calculation \nprocess in one version of a standardised framework. Other methodologies and calculation processes could be equally applicable in th is context, depending on the circumstances of \nthe bank concerned. Such a framework is intended for supervisory reporting purposes only, \nand is not intended to represent an adequate framework for internal risk management \npurposes. \nA. Methodology \n2. Positions on the bank\u2019s balance sheet would be slotted into the maturity approach \naccording to the following principles: \n(a) All assets and liabilities belonging to the banking book and all OBS items belonging \nto the banking book which are sensitive to changes in interest rates (including all \ninterest rate derivatives) are slotted into a maturity ladder comprising a number of \ntime bands large enough to capture the nature of interest rate risk in a national banking market. Annex 2 discusses issues relating to the selection of appropriate \ntime bands. Separate maturity ladders are to be used for each currency accounting for more than 5 per cent of either banking book assets or liabilities. \n(b)  On-balance-sheet items are treated at book value. \n(c) Fixed-rate instruments are allocated according to the residual term to maturity and \nfloating-rate instruments according to the residual term to the next repricing date. \n(d) Exposures which create practical processing problems because of their large \nnumber and relatively small individual amount  (e.g. instalment or mortgage loans) \nmay be allocated on the basis of statistically supported assessment methods. \n(e) Core deposits are slotted according to an assumed maturity of no longer than five \nyears. \n(f) National supervisors will provide guidance on how other items with a behavioural \nmaturity or repricing that differ from contractual maturity or repricing are to be slotted \ninto the time band structure. \n(g) Derivatives are converted into positions in the relevant underlying. The amounts  \nconsidered are the principal amount of the underlying or of the notional underlying. \n(h) Futures and forward contracts, including forward rate agreements (FRA), are treated \nas a combination of a long and a short position. The maturity of a future or a FRA \nwill be the period until delivery or exercise of the contract, plus - where applicable - \nthe life of the underlying instrument. For example, a long position in a June three-\nmonth interest rate future (taken in April) is to be reported as a long position with a \nmaturity of five months and a short position with a maturity of two months. \n(i) Swaps are treated as two notional positions with relevant maturities. For example, \nan interest rate swap under which a bank is receiving floating-rate interest and \n  212    \npaying fixed-rate interest will be treated as a long floating-rate position of maturity \nequivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short fixed-rate position of maturity equivalent to the residual life of the swap. The separate legs of cross-\ncurrency swaps are to be treated in the relevant maturity ladders for the currencies \nconcerned. \n(j) Options are considered according to the delta equivalent amount of the underlying \nor of the notional underlying. \nB. Calculation process \n3. The calculation process consists of five steps. \n(a) The first step is to offset the longs and shorts in each time band, resulting in \na single short or long position in each time band. \n(b) The second step is to weight these resulting short and long positions by a \nfactor that is designed to reflect the sensitivity of the positions in the different \ntime bands to an assumed change in interest rates. The set of weighting \nfactors for each time band is set out in Table 1 below. These factors are based on an assumed parallel shift of 200 basis points throughout the time \nspectrum, and on a proxy of modified duration of positions situated at the middle of each time band and yielding 5 per cent. \n(c) The third step is to sum these resulting weighted positions, offsetting longs \nand shorts, leading to the net short- or long-weighted position of the banking \nbook in the given currency. \n(d) The fourth step is to calculate the weighted position of the whole banking \nbook by summing the net short- and long-weighted positions calculated for different currencies. \n(e) The fifth step is to relate the weighted position of the whole banking book to capital.  \nTable 1 \nWeighting factors per time band (second step in the calculation process) \n \nTime band \n Middle of \ntime band  Proxy of \nmodified \nduration  Assumed \nchange in \nyield  Weighting \nfactor  \n \nUp to 1 month 0.5 months 0.04 years 200 bp 0.08% \n1 to 3 months 2 months  0.16 years 200 bp 0.32% \n3 to 6 months \n 4.5 months \n 0.36 years \n 200 bp \n 0.72% \n \n6 to 12 months 9 months  0.71 years 200 bp 1.43% \n1 to 2 years 1.5 years 1.38 years 200 bp 2.77% \n2 to 3 years \n 2.5 years \n 2.25 years \n 200 bp \n 4.49% \n \n3 to 4 years \n 3.5 years \n 3.07 years \n 200 bp \n 6.14% \n \n4 to 5 years \n 4.5 years \n 3.85 years \n 200 bp \n 7.71% \n \n5 to 7 years \n 6 years \n 5.08 years \n 200 bp \n 10.15%  \n7 to 10 years \n 8.5 years \n 6.63 years \n 200 bp \n 13.26% \n \n10 to 15 years \n 12.5 years \n 8.92 years \n 200 bp \n 17.84% \n \n15 to 20 years 17.5 year s 11.21 years 200 bp 22.43% \nOver 20 years \n 22.5 years \n 13.01 years \n 200 bp \n 26.03% \n \n  213    \n \n \nANNEX - 13                \n(Cf. Para 3.2.2 of Annex 10) \n \nAnnex 1 to the BCBS Paper on Principles for  \nManagement and Supervision of IRR, July 2004  \n \nInterest Rate Risk Measurement Techniques  \n1. This annex provides a brief overview of the various techniques used by banks to \nmeasure the exposure of earnings and of economic value to changes in interest rates. The \nvariety of techniques ranges from calculations that rely on simple maturity and re-pricing tables, to static simulations based on current on- and off-balance-sheet positions, to highly sophisticated dynamic modelling techniques that incorporate assumptions about the \nbehaviour of the bank and its customers in response to changes in the interest rate \nenvironment. Some of these general approaches can be used to measure interest rate risk exposure from both an earnings and an economic value perspective, while others are more typically associated with only one of these two perspectives. In addition, the methods vary in their ability to capture the different forms of interest rate exposure: the simplest methods \nare intended primarily to capture the risks aris ing from maturity and re-pricing mismatches, \nwhile the more sophisticated methods can more easily capture the full range of risk \nexposures. \n2. As this discussion suggests, the various measurement approaches described below \nhave their strengths and weaknesses in terms of providing accurate and reasonable \nmeasures of interest rate risk exposure. I deally, a bank's interest rate risk measurement \nsystem would take into account the specific characteristics of each individual interest sensitive position, and would capture in detail the full range of potential movements in \ninterest rates. In practice, however, meas urement systems embody simplifications that \nmove away from this ideal. For instance, in some approaches, positions may be aggregated \ninto broad categories, rather than modelled separately, introducing a degree of measurement error into the estimation of their interest rate sensitivity. Similarly, the nature of interest rate movements that each approach can incorporate may be limited: in some \ncases, only a parallel shift of the yield curve may be assumed or less than perfect \ncorrelations between interest rates may not be taken into account. Finally, the various approaches differ in their ability to capture the optionality inherent in many positions and instruments. The discussion in the following sections will highlight the areas of simplification that typically characterise each of the major interest rate risk measurement techniques. \n \n  214    \n \nA. Re-pricing schedules \n3. The simplest techniques for measuring a bank's interest rate risk exposure begin \nwith a maturity/re-pricing schedule that distributes interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and \nOBS positions into a certain number of predefined time bands according to their maturity (if fixed-rate) or time remaining to their next re-pricing (if floating-rate). Those assets and liabilities lacking definitive re-pricing intervals (e.g. sight deposits or savings accounts) or \nactual maturities that could vary from contractual maturities (e.g. mortgages with an option \nfor early repayment) are assigned to re-pricing time bands according to the judgement and past experience of the bank. \nI.  Gap analysis \n4. Simple maturity/re-pricing schedules can be used to generate simple indicators of \nthe interest rate risk sensitivity of both earnings and economic value to changing interest \nrates. When this approach is used to assess the interest rate risk of current earnings, it is typically referred to as gap analysis. Gap analysis was one of the first methods developed to measure a bank's interest rate risk exposure, and continues to be widely used by banks. \nTo evaluate earnings exposure, interest rate-sensitive liabilities in each time band are \nsubtracted from the corresponding interest rate-sensitive assets to produce a re-pricing \u201cgap\u201d for that time band. This gap can be multiplied by an assumed change in interest rates to yield an approximation of the change in net interest income that would result from such an interest rate movement. The size of the interest rate movement used in the analysis can \nbe based on a variety of factors, including historical experience, simulation of potential \nfuture interest rate movements, and the judgement of bank management. \n5. A negative, or liability-sensitive, gap o ccurs when liabilities exceed assets (including \nOBS positions) in a given time band. This means that an increase in market interest rates \ncould cause a decline in net interest income. Conversely, a positive, or asset-sensitive, gap \nimplies that the bank's net interest income could decline as a result of a decrease in the level of interest rates. \n6. These simple gap calculations can be augmented by information on the average \ncoupon on assets and liabilities in each time band. This information can be used to place \nthe results of the gap calculations in context. For instance, information on the average \ncoupon rate could be used to calculate estimates of the level of net interest income arising from positions maturing or repricing within a given time band, which would then provide a \n\u201cscale\u201d to assess the changes in income implied by the gap analysis. \n7. Although gap analysis is a very commonly used approach to assessing interest rate \n  215    \nrisk exposure, it has a number of shortcomings. First, gap analysis does not take account of \nvariation in the characteristics of different positions within a time band. In particular, all positions within a given time band are assumed to mature or re-price simultaneously, a \nsimplification that is likely to have greater impact on the precision of the estimates as the \ndegree of aggregation within a time band increases. Moreover, gap analysis ignores differences in spreads between interest rates that could arise as the level of market interest rates changes (basis risk). In addition, it does not take into account any changes in the \ntiming of payments that might occur as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. \nThus, it fails to account for differences in the sensitivity of income that may arise from option-related positions. For these reasons, gap analysis provides only a rough approximation of the actual change in net interest income which would result from the chosen change in the pattern of interest rates. Finally, most gap analyses fail to capture \nvariability in non-interest revenue and expenses, a potentially important source of risk to \ncurrent income. \nII. Duration \n8.  A maturity/re-pricing schedule can also be used to evaluate the effects of changing \ninterest rates on a bank's economic value by applying sensitivity weights to each time band. \nTypically, such weights are based on estimates of the duration of the assets and liabilities that fall into each time band. Duration is a measure of the percentage change in the economic value of a position that will occur given a small change in the level of interest \nrates.\n66   It reflects the timing and size of cash flows that occur before the instrument's \ncontractual maturity. Generally, the longer the maturity or next re-pricing date of the \ninstrument and the smaller the payments that occur before maturity (e.g. coupon payments), the higher the duration (in absolute value). Higher duration implies that a given change in the level of interest rates will have a larger impact on economic value. \n9. Duration-based weights can be used in combination with a maturity/re-pricing \nschedule to provide a rough approximation of the change in a bank's economic value that would occur given a particular change in the level of market interest rates. Specifically, an \n\u201caverage\u201d duration is assumed for the positions that fall into each time band. The average \ndurations are then multiplied by an assumed change in interest rates to construct a weight \n                                            \n66 Modified duration - which is standard duration divided by 1 + r, where r is the level of market interest rates \u2013 is \nan elasticity. As such, it reflects the percentage change in the economic value of the instrument for a given \npercentage change in 1 + r. As with simple duration , it assumes a linear relationship between percentage \nchanges in value and percentage changes in interest rates. The second form of duration relaxes this \nassumption, as well as the assumption that the timing of payments is fixed. Effective duration is the percentage \nchange in the price of the re levant instrument for a basis point change in yield. \n \n  216    \nfor each time band.  In some cases, different weights are used for different positions that fall \nwithin a time band,  reflecting  broad  differences  in  the  coupon  rates  and  maturities  (for instance, one weight for assets, and another for liabilities). In addition, different interest rate \nchanges are sometimes used for different time bands, generally to reflect differences in the \nvolatility of interest rates along the yield curve. The weighted gaps are aggregated across time bands to produce an estimate of the change in economic value of the bank that would result from the assumed changes in interest rates. \n10. Alternatively, an institution could estimate the effect of changing market rates by \ncalculating the precise duration of each asset, liability, and OBS position and then deriving the net position for the bank based on these more accurate measures, rather than by \napplying an estimated average duration weight to all positions in a given time band. This \nwould eliminate potential errors occurring when aggregating positions/cash flows. As \nanother variation, risk weights could also be designed for each time band on the basis of \nactual percentage changes in market values of hypothetical instruments that would result from a specific scenario of changing market rates. That approach - which is sometimes referred to as effective duration - would better capture the non-linearity of price movements \narising from significant changes in market interest rates and, thereby, would avoid an \nimportant limitation of duration. \n11. Estimates derived from a standard duration approach may provide an acceptable \napproximation of a bank's exposure to changes in economic value for relatively non-complex banks. Such estimates, however, generally focus on just one form of interest rate \nrisk exposure - repricing risk. As a result, they may not reflect interest rate risk arising, for \ninstance, from changes in the relationship among interest rates within a time band (basis risk). In addition, because such approaches typi cally use an average duration for each time \nband, the estimates will not reflect differences in the actual sensitivity of positions that can \narise from differences in coupon rates and the timing of payments. Finally, the simplifying \nassumptions that underlie the calculation of standard duration means that the risk of options may not be adequately captured. \nB. Simulation approaches \n12. Many banks (especially those using complex financial instruments or otherwise \nhaving complex risk profiles) employ more s ophisticated interest rate risk measurement \nsystems than those based on simple maturi ty/repricing schedules. These simulation \ntechniques typically involve detailed assessments of the potential effects of changes in \ninterest rates on earnings and economic value by simulating the future path of interest rates and their impact on cash flows. \n13. In some sense, simulation techniques can be seen as an extension and refinement \n  217    \nof the simple analysis based on maturity /repricing schedules. However, simulation \napproaches typically involve a more detailed breakdown of various categories of on- and off \nbalance-sheet  positions, so  that  specific  assumptions  about  the  interest  and  principal \npayments and non-interest income and expense arising from each type of position can be \nincorporated. In addition, simulation techniques can incorporate more varied and refined changes in the interest rate environment, ranging from changes in the slope and shape of the yield curve to interest rate scenarios derived from Monte Carlo simulations.\n \nI. Static simulation \n14. In static simulations , the cash flows arising solely from the bank's current on- and \noff-balance-sheet positions are assessed. For assessing the exposure of earnings, \nsimulations estimating the cash flows and resulting earnings streams over a specific period \nare conducted based on one or more assumed interest rate scenarios. Typically, although \nnot always, these simulations entail relatively straightforward shifts or tilts of the yield curve, \nor changes of spreads between different interest rates. When the resulting cash flows are simulated over the entire expected lives of the bank's holdings and discounted back to their present values, an estimate of the change in the bank's economic value can be \ncalculated.\n67\nII. Dynamic simulation \n15. In a dynamic simulation approach, the simulation builds in more detailed \nassumptions about the future course of interest rates and the expected changes in a bank's business activity over that time. For instance, the simulation could involve assumptions \nabout a bank's strategy for changing administered interest rates (on savings deposits, for \nexample), about the behaviour of the bank's customers (e.g. withdrawals from sight and savings deposits), and/or about the future stream of business (new loans or other transactions) that the bank will encounter. Such simulations use these assumptions about \nfuture activities and reinvestment strategies to project expected cash flows and estimate \ndynamic earnings and economic value outcomes. These more sophisticated techniques allow for dynamic interaction of payments streams and interest rates, and better capture the effect of embedded or explicit options. \n16. As with other approaches, the usefulness of simulation-based interest rate risk \nmeasurement techniques depends on the validity of the underlying assumptions and the \naccuracy of the basic methodology. The output of sophisticated simulations must be assessed largely in the light of the validity of the simulation's assumptions about future \n                                            \n67 The duration analysis described in the previous section can be viewed as a very simple form of static. \n  218    \ninterest rates and the behaviour of the bank and its customers. One of the primary concerns \nthat arises is that such simulations do not become \u201cblack boxes\u201d that lead to false confidence in the precision of the estimates. \nC. Additional issues \n17. One of the most difficult tasks when measur ing interest rate risk is how to deal with \nthose positions where behavioural maturity differs  from contractual maturity (or where there \nis no stated contractual maturity). On the asset side of the balance sheet, such positions \nmay include mortgages and mortgage-related securities, which can be subject to prepayment. In some countries, borrowers have the discretion to prepay their mortgages \nwith little or no penalty, which creates uncertainty about the timing of the cash flows \nassociated with these instruments. Although there is always some volatility in prepayments resulting from demographic factors (such as death, divorce, or job transfers) and macroeconomic conditions, most of the uncertainty surrounding prepayments arises from the response of borrowers to movements in interest rates. In general, declines in interest \nrates result in increasing levels of prepayments as borrowers refinance their loans at lower \nyields. In contrast, when interest rates rise unexpectedly, prepayment rates tend to slow, leaving the bank with a larger than anticipated volume of mortgages paying below current market rates. \n18. On the liability side, such positions include so-called non-maturity deposits such as sight \ndeposits and savings deposits, which can be withdrawn, often without penalty, at the discretion of the depositor. The treatment of such deposits is further complicated by the fact \nthat the rates received by depositors tend not to move in close correlation with changes in \nthe general level of market interest rates. In fact, banks can and do administer the rates on \nthe accounts with the specific intention of managing the volume of deposits retained.  \n19. The treatment of positions with embedded options is an issue of special concern in \nmeasuring the exposure of both current earnings and economic value to interest rate changes. In addition, the issue arises across the full spectrum of approaches to interest rate \nmeasurement, from simple gap analysis to the most sophisticated simulation techniques. In \nthe maturity/re-pricing schedule framework, banks typically make assumptions about the likely timing of payments and withdrawals on these positions and \u201cspread\u201d the balances across time bands accordingly. For instance, it might be assumed that certain percentages of a pool of 30-year mortgages prepay in given years during the life of the mortgages. As a \nresult, a large share of the mortgage balances that would have been assigned to the time \nband containing 30-year instruments would be spread among nearer-term time bands. In a simulation framework, more sophisticated be havioural assumptions could be employed, \nsuch as the use of option-adjusted pricing models to better estimate the timing and \n  219    \nmagnitude of cash flows under different interest rate environments. In addition, simulations \ncan incorporate the bank's assumptions about its likely future treatment of administered interest rates on non-maturity deposits. \n20. As with other elements of interest rate risk measurement, the quality of the estimates of interest rate risk exposure depends on the quality of the assumptions about the future cash flows on the positions with uncertain maturities. Banks typically look to the past \nbehaviour of such positions for guidance about these assumptions. For instance, \neconometric or statistical analysis can be used to analyse the behaviour of a bank's \nholdings in response to past interest rate movements. Such analysis is particularly useful to assess the likely behaviour of non-maturity deposits, which can be influenced by bank-specific factors such as the nature of the bank's customers and local or regional market conditions. In the same vein, banks may use statistical prepayment models - either models \ndeveloped internally by the bank or model s purchased from outside developers - to \ngenerate expectations about mortgage-related cash flows. Finally, input from managerial \nand business units within the bank could have an important influence, since these areas may be aware of planned changes to business or repricing strategies that could affect the \nbehaviour of the future cash flows of positions with uncertain maturities.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  220    \n \n \n \nANNEX - 14 \n            (Cf. Para 3.2.2 of Annex 10) \n \nAnnex 2 t o the BCBS Paper on Principles for Management and Supervision of IRR, July 2004  \n \nMonitoring of interest rate risk by supervisory authorities  \n1. This annex provides a brief overview of some of the factors that supervisory \nauthorities might consider in obtaining and analysing information on individual banks' exposures to interest rate risk. As discussed in Section VII, supervisory authorities should \nobtain information sufficient to assess banks' exposures to interest rate risk in a timely \nfashion. Such information may be obtained through on-site examinations, through reports \nthat are submitted by banks on a regular basis, or through other means.  \n2. While the precise information that is obtained will differ across supervisory \nauthorities, one approach that some may adopt is a reporting framework that collects information on a bank's positions by remaining ma turity or time to next re-pricing. Under \nsuch an approach, a bank would categorise its interest-sensitive assets, liabilities, and OBS \npositions into a series of re-pricing time bands or maturity categories. The two sections that \nfollow discuss the considerations that a supervisor should take into account in specifying the number of time bands and the grouping of positions in the reporting framework. The final section of this annex describes some general approaches that supervisory authorities \nmay wish to consider in analysing the information that is obtained through such a reporting \nframework. \nA. Time bands \n3. If a reporting framework is used in which information is collected by time to next re-\npricing, the number and specific categories of time bands chosen should be sufficient to provide supervisors with a reasonable basis for identifying potentially significant re-pricing \nmismatches. The bands, however, could vary ma terially across countries, both in number \nand in range, depending on the lending and investing practices and experiences of banks in \nindividual markets. \n4. The usefulness of supervisory analysis crucially depends on the precision with which \nmaturities of the positions and cash flows are recorded in the system. In analysing interest \nrate sensitivities, it is not enough to know when an instrument matures. Rather, the critical \nfactor is when the instrument re-prices. Therefore, the emphasis of this section is on re-pricing rather than maturity. For cash flows whose re-pricing is unambiguous, the most \n  221    \nprecise approach is to use the exact re-pricing date. Any aggregation of positions/cash \nflows in time bands or zones necessarily implies a loss of information and a lower degree of precision. For this reason, the number of time bands in a re-pricing ladder framework \nalways reflects a decision regarding the necessary level of precision and the cost of \npursuing greater accuracy. Supervisory authorities could use the re-pricing ladder in the standardised approach of the Market Risk Amendment as a starting point when developing a reporting framework that meets their particular needs. The breakdown can, of course, be \nmodified by supervisors either in a general way or in a specific way for banks where the \nnature of business activities warrants or justifies a different reporting form. \nB. Items  \n5. As with the time bands, the breakdown of assets and liabilities could differ among \nsupervisors. A reporting system should include information for all rate-sensitive assets, liabilities, and OBS positions, and should also identify balances, by specific types of \ninstruments, when those instruments have or may have materially different cash flow \ncharacteristics. Specific attention should be given to items whose behavioural re-pricings \ndiffer from contractual maturities, such as savings deposits and, in some countries, \nmortgage-related instruments. Further information on these issues is provided in Annex 1. If \nthe volume of these positions is significant, they should be reported separately so as to \nfacilitate an assessment of the underlying options risk in the bank\u2019s balance sheet structure. \n6. The analysis of interest rate risk may be more difficult if a bank is engaged in trading \nactivities. As a general rule, it is desirable for any measurement system to incorporate \ninterest rate risk exposures arising from the full scope of a bank's activities, including both \ntrading and non-trading sources. This does no t preclude different measurement systems \nand risk management approaches being used for different activities; however, management \nshould have an integrated view of interest rate risk across products and business lines. Supervisors may wish to permit banks that manage their interest rate risk exposures on an integrated basis to aggregate trading and non-trading positions in the overall reporting \nframework. However, it is important to recogni se that in many countries different accounting \nrules may apply to the trading book and the traditional banking book. Under these \naccounting rules, losses in the trading book may not always be offset by profits in the banking book if the latter are unrealised. Furthermore, unlike the banking book, the composition of the trading portfolio changes signific antly from week to week or even day to \nday because it is managed separately and according to a different (shorter) risk horizon than the banking book. This means that a hedge that is present on a given day may disappear a few days later. Supervisors shoul d, therefore, review the risk management \npractices and information systems of banks that conduct material trading activities and \n  222    \nshould obtain the information necessary to ensure that interest rate risk in both trading and \nnon-trading activities is properly managed and controlled.  \nC. Supervisory analysis  \n7. A reporting framework designed along these lines may provide supervisors with a flexible tool for analysing interest rate risk. Supervisors can use this basic information to \nperform their own assessments of a bank's exposure and risk profile.  \n8. Such assessments may provide insights regarding an institution's exposure to parallel shifts, or to a flattening, steepening, or inversion of the yield curve with rate changes of different magnitude based on either statistical probabilities or a worst-case analysis. For \nbanks with important exposures in foreign currencies, analysis investigating different \nassumptions regarding correlations between interest rates in different currencies can be useful. With respect to instruments with behav ioural maturities, supervisors may wish to \nassess assumptions that differ from those used by the institution. \n9. The focus of supervisors' quantitative analysis can be the impact of interest rate \nchanges on either current earnings or the economic value of the bank\u2019s portfolio. In \nconducting their analysis, information about average yields on assets and liabilities in each time band may be useful and supervisors may wish to collect such information in addition to pure position data. \n10. Depending on their overall approach, supervisors may conduct their analysis of \ninterest rate risk either on a case-by-case basis or as part of a broader system designed to identify outliers with apparently excessive risk-taking.  \n11. By conducting an assessment of interest rate risk using the proposed framework, supervisors may gain more insight into an institution's risk profile than with a reporting \nsystem that reduces the complexity of interest rate risk to a single number. In doing so, \nsupervisors can become more familiar with the sensitivity of risk measures to changes in the underlying assumptions, and the evaluation process may produce as many insights as \nthe quantitative result itself. \n12. Regardless of the extent of a supervisor's own independent quantitative analysis, a \nbank's own interest rate risk measure, whether reported as part of a basic supervisory reporting system or reviewed as part of an individual assessment of a bank's risk \nmanagement, is an important consideration in the supervisory process. Reviewing the \nresults of a bank's internal model can be highly informative, but can also be a difficult \nprocess because of the multitude of important assumptions and modelling techniques which \nneed to be made transparent to supervisors. To be most useful, the information received should indicate the contribution of principal elements of a bank's portfolio to the risk profile \n  223    \nunder different assumptions with respect to interest rate changes and the market response. \nFinally, any quantitative analysis should be supplemented by a review of internal management reports in order to gain greater  insights into management's evaluation and \nmanagement of risks, its methods for measuring exposures, and factors not reflected in the \ninformation available in the limited reporting to supervisors.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  224    \n \n \nANNEX \u2013 15 \n(Cf. Para 12.3.3.7) \n \nAn illustrative outline of the ICAAP Document  \n1. What is an ICAAP document?  \nThe ICAAP Document would be a comprehensive Paper furnishing detailed \ninformation on the ongoing assessment of the bank\u2019s entire spectrum of risks, how the bank \nintends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future capital is necessary for the \nbank, reckoning other mitigating factors. The purpose of the ICAAP document is to apprise \nthe Board of the bank on these aspects as also to explain to the RBI the bank\u2019s internal \ncapital adequacy assessment process and the banks\u2019 approach to capital management. The ICAAP could also be based on the existing internal documentation of the bank. \nThe ICAAP document submitted to the RB I should be formally approved by the \nbank\u2019s Board. It is expected that the document would be prepared in a format that would be \neasily understood at the senior levels of management and would contain all the relevant \ninformation necessary for the bank and the RBI to make an informed judgment as to the \nappropriate capital level of the bank and its risk management approach. Where appropriate, \ntechnical information on risk measurement me thodologies, capital models, if any, used and \nall other work carried out to validate the approach (e.g. board papers and minutes, internal \nor external reviews) could be furnished to the RBI as appendices to the ICAAP Document. \n2. Contents  \nThe ICAAP Document should contain the following sections: \n \nI. Executive Summary  \n \nII. Background  \n \nIII. Summary of current and projected financial and capital positions   \n \nIV. Capital Adequacy  \n \nV. Key sensitivities and future scenarios  \n \nVI. Aggregation and diversification  \n \nVII. Testing and adoption of the ICAAP  \n \nVIII. Use of the ICAAP within the bank  \n  225    \n \nI. Executive Summary  \nThe purpose of the Executive Summary is to present an overview of the ICAAP \nmethodology and results. This overview would typically include: \na) the purpose of the report and the regulated entities within a banking group \nthat are covered by the ICAAP; \nb) the main findings of the ICAAP analysis: \ni. how much and what composition of internal capital the bank considers it \nshould hold as compared with the minimum CRAR requirement (CRAR) \nunder \u2018Pillar 1\u2019 calculation, and \nii. the adequacy of the bank\u2019s risk management processes; \nc) a summary of the financial position of the bank, including the strategic \nposition of the bank, its balance sheet strength, and future profitability; \nd) brief descriptions of the capital raising and dividend plan including how the \nbank intends to manage its capital in the days ahead and for what purposes; \ne) commentary on the most material risks to which the bank is exposed, why \nthe level of risk is considered acceptable or, if it is not, what mitigating actions are planned; \nf) commentary on major issues where further analysis and decisions are \nrequired; and \ng) who has carried out the assessment, how it has been challenged / validated / \nstress tested, and who has approved it. \n \nII. Background   \nThis section would cover the relevant organisational and historical financial data for the \nbank. e.g., group structure (legal and operational), operating profit, profit before tax, profit after tax, dividends, shareholders funds, capital funds held vis-\u00e0-vis the regulatory \nrequirements, customer deposits, deposits by ba nks, total assets, and any conclusions that \ncan be drawn from trends in the data which may have implications for the bank\u2019s future. \nIII. Summary of current and projected financial and capital positions  \nThis section would explain the present financial position of the bank and expected changes \nto the current business profile, the environment in which it expects to operate, its projected business plans (by appropriate lines of business), projected financial position, and future \nplanned sources of capital. \nThe starting balance sheet used as reference and date as of which the assessment is \ncarried out should be indicated. \nThe projected financial position could reckon both the projected capital available and projected capital requirements based on envisaged business plans. These might then \nprovide a basis against which adverse scenarios might be compared. \n  226    \n \nIV. Capital adequacy  \nThis section might start with a description of the bank\u2019s risk appetite, in quantitative terms, \nas approved by the bank\u2019s Board and used in t he ICAAP.  It would be necessary to clearly \nspell out in the document whether what is being presented represents the bank\u2019s view of the \namount of capital required to meet minimum regulatory needs  or whether represents the \namount of capital that a bank believes it would need to meet its business plans . For \ninstance, it should be clearly brought out whether the capital required is based on a \nparticular credit rating desired by the bank or includes buffers for strategic purposes or \nseeks to minimise the chance of breaching regulatory requirements. Where economic \ncapital models are used for internal capital assessment, the confidence level, time horizon, and description of the event to which the confidence level relates, should also be enumerated.  Where scenario analyses or ot her means are used for capital assessment, \nthen the basis / rationale for selecting the chosen severity of scenarios used, should also be \nincluded. \nThe section would then include a detailed review of the capital adequacy of the bank. \nThe information provided would include the following elements: \nTiming \n\u2022 the effective date of the ICAAP calculations together with details of any events \nbetween this date and the date of submission to the Board / RBI which would \nmaterially impact the ICAAP calculations together with their effects; and \n\u2022 details of, and rationale for, the time period selected for which capital requirement \nhas been assessed. \nRisks analysed \n\u2022 an identification of the major risks faced by the bank in each of the following \ncategories: \na) credit risk \nb) market risk \nc) operational risk \nd) liquidity risk \ne) concentration risk \nf) interest rate risk in the banking book  \ng) residual risk  of securitisation \nh) strategic risk \ni) business risk \nj) reputation risk \nk) pension obligation risk \nl) other residual risk; and \nm) any other risks that might have been identified  \n \n\u2022 for each of these risks, an explanation of how the risk has been assessed and o the \nextent possible, the quantitative results of that assessment; \n  227    \n \n\u2022 where some of these risks have been highlighted in the report of the RBI\u2019s on-site \ninspection of the bank, an explanation of how the bank has mitigated these; \n\u2022 where relevant, a comparison of the RBI-assessed CRAR during on-site inspection \nwith the results of the CRAR calculations of the bank under the ICAAP; \n\u2022 a clear articulation of the bank\u2019s risk appetite, in quantitative terms, by risk category \nand the extent of its consistency (its \u2018fit\u2019) with the overall assessment of bank\u2019s \nvarious risks; and \n\u2022 where relevant, an explanation of any other methods, apart from capital, used by the \nbank to mitigate the risks. \n \nMethodology and assumptions \nA description of how assessments for each of the major risks have been approached and \nthe main assumptions made.  \nFor instance, banks may choose to base their ICAAP on the results of the CRAR calculation \nwith the capital for additional risks (e.g. concentration risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, etc.) assessed separately and added to the Pillar 1 computations. Alternatively, banks \ncould choose to base their ICAAP on internal m odels for all risks, including those covered \nunder the CRAR (i.e. Credit, Market and Operational Risks). \nThe description here would make clear which risks are covered by which modelling or \ncalculation approach. This would include details of the methodology and process used to \ncalculate risks in each of the categories identified and reason for choosing the method used \nin each case. \nWhere the bank uses an internal model for the quantification of its risks, this section should \nexplain for each of those models: \n\u2022 the key assumptions and parameters within the capital modelling work and \nbackground information on the derivation of any key assumptions; \n\u2022 how parameters have been chosen, including the historical period used and the \ncalibration process; \n\u2022 the limitations of the model; \n\u2022 the sensitivity of the model to changes in those key assumptions or parameters \nchosen; and \n\u2022 the validation work undertaken to ensure the continuing adequacy of the model. \n \nWhere stress tests or scenario analyses have been used to validate, supplement, or probe the results of other modelling approaches, then this section should provide: \n \n  228    \n\u2022 details of simulations to capture risks not well estimated by the bank\u2019s internal \ncapital model (e.g. non-linear products, concentrations, illiquidity and shifts in \ncorrelations in a crisis period); \n \n\u2022 details of the quantitative results of stress tests and scenario analyses the bank \ncarried out and the confidence levels and key assumptions behind those analyses, including, the distribution of outcomes obtained for the main individual \nrisk factors; \n \n\u2022 details of the range of combined adverse scenarios which have been applied, \nhow these were derived and the resulting capital requirements; and \n \n\u2022 where applicable, details of any additional business-unit-specific or business-\nplan-specific stress tests selected. \n \nCapital transferability \nIn case of banks with conglomerate structure, details of any restrictions on the \nmanagement\u2019s ability to transfer capital into or  out of the banking business(es) arising from, \nfor example, by contractual, commercial, regulatory or statutory constraints that apply, \nshould be furnished. Any restrictions applicable and flexibilities available for distribution of \ndividend by the entities in the Group could also be enumerated. In case of overseas \nbanking subsidiaries of the banks, the regulatory restrictions would include the minimum regulatory capital level acceptable to the host-country regulator of the subsidiary, after declaration of dividend. \nV. Firm-wide risk oversight and specifc aspects of risk management  \n V.1   Risk Management System in the bank  \n This section would describe the risk management infrastructure within the \nbank along the following lines: \n\u2022 The oversight of board and senior management \n\u2022 Policies, Procedures and Limits \n\u2022 identification,measurement, mitigation, controlling and reporting of risks  \n\u2022 MIS at the firm wide level \n\u2022 Internal controls \nV.2    Off-balance sheet exposures with a focus on securitisation  \nThis section woul comprehensively discuss and analyse underlying risks \ninherent in the off-balance sheet exposures particularly its investment in \nstructured products. When assessing securitisation exposures, bank should \nthoroughly nalyse the credit quality and risk characteristics of of the \nunderlying exposures. This section should also comprehensively explain the \nmaturity of the exposures underlying securitisation transactions relative to \nissued liabilities in order to assess potential maturity mismatches. \n  229    \n \n \n \nV.3   Assesssment of reputational risk and implicit support  \nThis section should discuss the possibilities of reputational risk leading to \nprovision of implicit support, which might give rise to credit, market and legal \nrisks. This section should thoroughly discuss potential sources of \nreputational risk to the bank. \nV. 4   Assessment of  valuation and liquidity risk  \nThis section would describe the governance structures and control processes \nfor valuing exposures for risk management and financial reporting purposes, \nwith a special focus on valuation of illiquid positions. This section will have \nrelevant details leading to establishment and verification of valuations for \ninstruments and transactions in which it engages. \nV. 5    Stress testing practices  \nThis section would explain the role of board and senior management in setting \nstress testing objectives, defining scenarios, discussing the results of stress \ntests, assessing potential actions and decision making on the basis of results \nof stress tests. This section would also describe the rigorous and forward looking stress testing that identifies possible events or changes in market \nconditions that could adversely the bank.RBI would assess the effectiveness of banks\u2019 stress testing programme in identifying relevant vulnerabilities. \nV. 6 Sound compensation practices  \nThis section should describe the compensation practices followed by the bank \nand how far the compensation practices are linked to long-term capital \npreservation and the financial strength of the firm. The calculation of risk-\nadjusted performance measure for the employees and its link, if any, with the \ncompensation should clearly be disclosed in this section \n \n \nVI. Key sensitivities and future scenarios   \nThis section would explain how a bank would be affected by an economic recession or \ndownswings in the business cycle or markets relevant to its activities. The RBI would like to be apprised as to how a bank would manage its business and capital so as to survive a \nrecession while meeting the minimum regulatory standards. The analysis would include \nfuture financial projections for, say, three to five years based on business plans and \nsolvency calculations. \nFor the purpose of this analysis, the severity of the recession reckoned should typically be \none that occurs only once in a 25 year period. The time horizon would be from the day of \nthe ICAAP calculation to at least the deepest part of the recession envisaged. \n \n  230    \nTypical scenarios would include: \n\u2022  how an economic downturn would affect: \n \n\u0083 the bank\u2019s capital funds and future earnings; and \n \n\u0083 the bank\u2019s CRAR taking into account future changes in its projected \nbalance sheet. \n \n\u2022 In both cases, it would be helpful if these projections show separately the effects of \nmanagement actions to change the bank\u2019s business strategy and the \nimplementation of contingency plans. \n \n\u2022 projections of the future CRAR would include the effect of changes in the credit \nquality of the bank\u2019s credit risk counterparties (including migration in their ratings \nduring a recession) and the bank\u2019s capital and its credit risk capital requirement; \n\u2022 an assessment by the bank of any other capital planning actions to enable it to \ncontinue to meet its regulatory capital requirements throughout a recession such as \nnew capital injections from related companies or new share issues; \n\u2022 This section would also explain which key macroeconomic factors are being \nstressed, and how those have been identified as drivers of the bank\u2019s earnings. The bank would also explain how the macroeconomic factors affect the key parameters \nof the internal model by demonstrating, for instance, how the relationship between the two has been established. \n \nManagement Actions \nThis section would elaborate on the managemen t actions assumed in deriving the ICAAP, \nin particular: \n\u2022 the quantitative impact of management actions \u2013 sensitivity testing of key \nmanagement actions and revised ICAAP figures with management actions \nexcluded. \n\u2022 evidence of management actions implemented in the past during similar periods of \neconomic stress. \n \nVII. Aggregation and diversification  \nThis section would describe how the results of the various separate risk assessments are \nbrought together and an overall view taken on capital adequacy.  At a technical level, this \nwould, therefore, require some method to be used to combine the various risks using some appropriate quantitative techniques. At the broader level, the overall reasonableness of the detailed quantification approaches might be compared with the results of an analysis of \ncapital planning and a view taken by senior management as to the overall level of capital \nthat is considered appropriate. \n\u2022 In enumerating the process of technical aggregation, the following aspects could be \ncovered: \ni) any allowance made for diversification, including any assumed \ncorrelations within risks and between risks and how such correlations \nhave been assessed, including in stressed conditions; \n  231    \n \nii) the justification for any credit taken for diversification benefits \nbetween legal entities, and the justification for the free movement of \ncapital, if any assumed, between them in times of financial stress; \n \niii) the impact of diversification benefits with management actions \nexcluded. It might be helpful to work out revised ICAAP figures with all correlations set to \u20181\u2019 i.e., no diversification; and similar figures with \nall correlations set to \u20180\u2019 i.e. assuming all risks are independent i.e., full diversification. \n \n\u2022 As regards the overall assessment, this should describe how the bank has arrived at \nits overall assessment of the capital it needs taking into account such matters as: \ni) the inherent uncertainty in any modelling approach; \nii)  weaknesses in the bank\u2019s risk  management procedures, systems or \ncontrols; \niii) the differences between regulatory capital and internal capital; and \niv) the differing purposes that capital serves: shareholder returns, rating \nobjectives for the bank as a whole or for certain debt instruments the bank has issued, avoidance of regulatory intervention, protection against uncertain events, depositor protection, working capital, capital held for strategic acquisitions, etc. \n \nVIII. Testing and adoption of the ICAAP  \nThis section would describe the extent of challenging and testing that the ICAAP has been \nsubjected to. It would thus include the testing and control processes applied to the ICAAP \nmodels and calculations. It should also describe the process of review of the test results by the senior management or the Board and the approv al of the results by them.  A copy of \nany relevant report placed before the senior management or the Board of the bank in this \nregard, along with their response, could be attached to the ICAAP Document sent to the \nRBI. \n \nDetails of the reliance placed on any external se rvice providers or consultants in the testing \nprocess, for instance, for generating economic scenarios, could also be detailed here. \n \nIn addition, a copy of any report obtained from an external reviewer or internal audit should \nalso be sent to the RBI. \n \nIX. Use of the ICAAP within the bank  \nThis section would contain information to demonstrate the extent to which the concept of capital management is embedded within the bank, including the extent and use of capital \nmodelling or scenario analyses and stress testing within the bank\u2019s capital management policy. For instance, use of ICAAP in setting pricing and charges and the level and nature of future business, could be an indicator in this regard. \n \nThis section could also include a statement of the bank\u2019s actual operating philosophy on \ncapital management and how this fits in to the ICAAP Document submitted. For instance, \n  232    \ndifferences in risk appetite used in preparing the ICAAP Document vis-\u00e0-vis that used for \nbusiness decisions might be discussed.    \nLastly, the banks may also furnish the details of any anticipated future refinements \nenvisaged in the ICAAP (highlighting those aspects  which are work-in-progress) apart from \nany other information that the bank believes would be helpful to the RBI in reviewing the \nICAAP Document. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  233    \n \n \n \n \n \n \nANNEX \u2013 16 \n \nGLOSSARY  \n \n \nAsset An asset is anything of value that is owned by a person or business\nAvailable for Sale The securities available for sale are those securities where the intention of \nthe bank is neither to tr ade nor to hold till maturity. These securities are \nvalued at the fair value which is determined by reference to the best \navailable source of current market quotat ions or other data relative to current \nvalue. \nBalance Sheet A balance sheet is a financial statement of the assets and liabilities of a \ntrading concern, recorded at a particular point in time. \nBanking Book The banking book comprises assets and liabilities, which are contracted basically on account of relationship or for steady income and statutory \nobligations and are generally held till maturity.  \nBasel Capital \nAccord \n The Basel Capital Accord is an Agreement concluded among country representatives in 1988 to develop standardised risk-based capital requirements for banks across countries. The Accord was replaced with a \nnew capital adequacy framework (Basel  II), published in June 2004.   \n \nBasel II is based on three mutually re inforcing pillars that allow banks and \nsupervisors to evaluate properly the various risks that banks face. These \nthree pillars are:  \n \n minimum capital requirements, which seek to refine the present \nmeasurement framework \n supervisory review of an institution's capital adequacy and internal \nassessment process;  \n market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and sound banking practices \n \nBasel Committee \non Banking Supervision \n The Basel Committee is a committee of  bank supervisors consisting of \nmembers from each of the G10 countries. The Committee is a forum for discussion on the handling of specific  supervisory problems. It coordinates \nthe sharing of supervisory responsib ilities among national authorities in \nrespect of banks' foreign establishments with the aim of ensuring effective \nsupervision of banks' activities worldwide. \nBasic Indicator \nApproachAn operational risk measurement technique permitted under Basel II. The approach sets a charge for operational  risk as a fixed percentage (\"alpha \nfactor\") of a single indicator. The indi cator serves as a proxy for the bank's \nrisk exposure.\nBasis Risk The risk that the interest rate of diffe rent assets, liabilities and off-balance \nsheet items may change in different magnitude is termed as basis risk. \nCapital  Capital refers to the funds (e.g., money, loans, equity, etc.) which are \n  234    \n \n available to carry on a business, make an investment, and generate future \nrevenue. Capital also refers to physical assets which can be used to \ngenerate future returns.\n \nCapital \nadequacyA measure of the adequacy of an entity's capital resources in relation to its current liabilities and also in relation to t he risks associated with its assets.   \nAn appropriate level of capital adequacy ensures that the entity has sufficient \ncapital to support its activities and that it s net worth is sufficient to absorb adverse \nchanges in the value of its assets without becoming insolvent. For example, under \nBIS (Bank for International Settlements) ru les, banks are required to maintain a \ncertain level of capital against their risk-adjusted assets.\nCapital \nreservesThat portion of a company's profits not  paid out as dividends to shareholders. \nThey are also known as undistributable reserves.\nConvertible Bond A bond giving the investor the option to convert the bond into equity at a fixed conversion price or as per a pre-determined pricing formula. \nCore Capital Tier I capital is generally referred to as Core Capital \nCredit risk Risk that a party to a contractual agreement or transaction will be unable to meet \ntheir obligations or will default on commitments. \nCredit risk can be associated with almost  any transaction or instrument such as \nswaps, repos, CDs, foreign exchange transactions, etc. \n Specific types of credit risk include sovereign risk, country risk, legal or force \nmajeure risk, marginal risk and settlement risk.\nDebentures Bonds issued by a company bearing a fix ed rate of interest usually payable half \nyearly on specific dates and principal amount repayable on a particular date on \nredemption of the debentures. \nDeferred Tax Assets Unabsorbed depreciation and carry forward of losses which can be set-off against future taxable income which is considered as timing differences result in deferred \ntax assets. The deferred Tax Assets are accounted as per the Accounting \nStandard 22. \nDeferred Tax Assets have an effect of decreasing future income tax payments, \nwhich indicates that they are prepaid income taxes and meet definition of assets. \nWhereas deferred tax liabilities have an effe ct of increasing futu re year's income \ntax payments, which indicates that they  are accrued income taxes and meet \ndefinition of liabilities \nDelta (\u2206) The delta of an option / a portfolio of options is the rate of change in the value of \nthe option / portfolio with respect to change in the price of the asset(s) underlying the option(s). \nDerivative A derivative instrument derives much of  its value from an underlying product. \nExamples of derivatives include fu tures, options, forwards and swaps.  For \nexample, a forward contract  can be derived from the spot currency market and \nthe spot markets for borrowing and lending.  In the past, derivative instruments \ntended to be restricted only to those pr oducts which could be derived from spot \nmarkets. However, today the term seems to be used for any product that can be \nderived from any other.\nDuration \n Duration (Macaulay duration) measures the price volatility of fixed income \nsecurities. It is often used in the comparison of the interest rate risk between securities with different coupons and different maturities.\n It is the weighted \naverage of the present value of all the ca sh flows associated with a fixed income \nsecurity. It is expressed in years. The dura tion of a fixed income security is always \nshorter than its term to maturity, except in the case of zero coupon securities \nwhere they are the same.\nForeign An institution established or incorpor ated outside India which proposes to make \n  235    \nInstitutional \nInvestor \n investment in India insecurities; provided that a domestic asset management company or domestic portfolio manager who manages funds raised or collected \nor brought from outside India for investm ent in India on behalf of a sub-account, \nshall be deemed to be a Foreign Institutional Investor.  \n \nForward \nContractA forward contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell an agreed amount of a commodity or financial instrume nt at an agreed price, for delivery on \nan agreed future date. In contrast to a fu tures contract, a forward contract is not \ntransferable or exchange tradable, its terms are not standardized and no margin is exchanged. The buyer of the forward c ontract is said to be long the contract \nand the seller is said to be short the contract.\nGamma( \u0413) \n The gamma of an option / portfolio of options is the rate of change of the option\u2019s / \nportfolio\u2019s delta with respect to the change in the price of the asset(s) underlying \nthe option (s). \nGeneral \nprovisions & loss reservesSuch reserves, if they are not attributab le to the actual diminution in value or \nidentifiable potential loss in any specific asset and are available to meet unexpected losses, can be included in Tier II capital.\nGeneral \nmarket riskRisk that relates to overall market conditions while specific risk is risk that relates \nto the issuer of a particular security\nHedging Taking action to eliminate or reduce exposure to risk\nHeld for \nTrading Securities where the intention is to trade  by taking advantage of short-term price / \ninterest rate movements.  \nHorizontal Disallowance A disallowance of offsets  to required capital used the BIS Method for assessing \nmarket risk  for regulatory capital .   In order to calculate the capital required for  \ninterest rate risk  of a trading portfolio, the BIS Method allows offsets of long and \nshort  positions.  Yet interest rate risk of instruments at different horizontal points \nof the yield curve  are not perfectly correlated.  Hence, the BIS Method requires \nthat a portion of these offsets be disallowed.  \nHybrid debt capital instruments In this category, fall a number of capital instruments, which combine certain characteristics of equity and certain characteristics of debt. Each has a particular feature, which can be considered to affe ct its quality as capital. Where these \ninstruments have close similarities to equi ty, in particular when they are able to \nsupport losses on an ongoing basis wit hout triggering liquidation, they may be \nincluded in Tier II capital.\nInterest rate \nriskRisk that the financial value of assets or liabilities (or inflows/outflows) will be altered because of fluctuations in interest rates.\n For example, the risk that future \ninvestment may have to be made at lower rates and future borrowings at higher \nrates.\nLong \nPositionA long position refers to a position where gains arise from a rise in the value of the underlying. \nMarket risk Risk of loss arising from movements in ma rket prices or rates away from the rates \nor prices set out in a transaction or agreement.\nModified \nDuration \n The modified duration or volatility of an in terest bearing security is its Macaulay \nduration divided by one plus the coupon rate of the security. It represents the \npercentage change in a securities' price fo r a 100 basis points change in yield. It \nis generally accurate for only small changes in the yield. \n \nwhere:  \nMD = Modified duration \nP = Gross price (i.e. clean price plus accrued interest). \n  236    \ndP = Corresponding small change in price. \ndY = Small change in yield compounded with the frequency of the coupon \npayment. \n \nMortgage-\nbacked \nsecurityA bond-type security in which the collateral is provided by a pool of mortgages. \nIncome from the underlying mortgages is  used to meet interest and principal \nrepayments.\nMutual Fund Mutual Fund is a mechanism for pooling the resources by issuing units to the investors and investing funds in securiti es in accordance with objectives as \ndisclosed in offer document. A fund established in the form of a trust to raise \nmonies through the sale of units to the public or a section of the public under one \nor more schemes for investing in securities, including money market instruments.  \nNet Interest Margin Net interest margin is the net interest income divided by average interest earning assets \nNet NPA Net NPA = Gross NPA \u2013 (Balance in Inte rest Suspense account + DICGC/ECGC \nclaims received and held pending adjustment + Part payment received and kept in \nsuspense account + Total provisions held)\u2018 \nNostro \naccountsForeign currency settlement accounts that a bank maintains with its overseas correspondent banks.  These accounts are assets of the domestic bank. \nOff-Balance \nSheet expos-ures Off-Balance Sheet exposures refer to the business activities of a bank that generally do not involve booking assets (loans) and taking deposits. Off-balance sheet activities normally generate fees, but  produce liabilities or assets that are \ndeferred or contingent and thus, do not appear on the institution's balance sheet \nuntil or unless they become actual assets or liabilities. \nOpen \npositionIt is the net difference between the amo unts payable and amounts receivable in a \nparticular instrument or commodity. It results from the existence of a net long or \nnet short position in the particular instrument or commodity.\nOption An option is a contract which grants the buy er the right, but not the obligation, to \nbuy (call option) or sell (put option) an  asset, commodity, currency or financial \ninstrument at an agreed rate (exercise price) on or before an agreed date (expiry \nor settlement date). The buyer pays the seller an amount called the premium in \nexchange for this right. This premium is the price of the option.\nRho(\u03c1) Rho of an option / a portfolio of options is the rate of change in the value of an \noption / portfolio with respect to chan ge in the level of interest rates. \nRisk The possibility of an outcome not occurr ing as expected. It can be measured and \nis not the same as uncertainty, which is not measurable. In financial terms, risk \nrefers to the possibility of financial loss. It can be classified as credit risk, market \nrisk and operational risk.\nRisk Asset Ratio A bank's risk asset ratio is the ratio of a ban k's risk assets to its capital funds. Risk \nassets include assets other than highl y rated government and government agency \nobligations and cash, for example, cor porate bonds and loans. The capital funds \ninclude capital and undistributed reserves. The lower the risk asset ratio the better \nthe bank's 'capital cushion'\nRisk Weights Basel II sets out a risk-weighting schedule for measuring the credit risk of obligors. The risk weights are linked to ratings given to sovereigns, financial \ninstitutions and corporations by external credit rating agencies.\nSecuritis-\nationThe process whereby similar debt inst ruments/assets are pooled together and \nrepackaged into marketable securities which can be sold to investors. The process of loan securitisation is used by banks to move their assets off the \nbalance sheet in order to improve their capital asset ratios. \nShort \npositionA short position refers to a position where gains arise from a decline in the value \nof the underlying. It also refers to the sa le of a security in which the seller does \nnot have a long position.\n  237    \nSpecific risk Within the framework of the BIS proposals on market risk, specific risk refers to \nthe risk associated with a specific securi ty, issuer or company, as opposed to the \nrisk associated with a market or  market sector (general risk).\nSubordinated \ndebtRefers to the status of the debt. In the ev ent of the bankruptcy or liquidation of the \ndebtor, subordinated debt only has a secondary claim on repayments, after other debt has been repaid. \n \nTheta(\u03b8) The theta of an option / a portfolio of options is the rate of change in the value of the option / portfolio with respect to passage of time, with all else remaining the same. It is also called the \u201ctime decay\u201d of the option. \n \nTier one (or Tier I) capital A term used to refer to one of the components of regulatory capital. It consists mainly of share capital and disclose d reserves (minus goodwill, if any).\n Tier I \nitems are deemed to be of the highest quality because they are fully available to \ncover losses. The other categories of capi tal defined in Basel II are Tier II (or \nsupplementary) capital and Tier II (or additional supplementary) capital. \n \nTier two (or \nTier II) capitalRefers to one of components of regulatory capital. Also known as supplementary capital, it consists of certain reserv es and certain types of subordinated debt.\n Tier \nII items qualify as regulatory capital to t he extent that they can be used to absorb \nlosses arising from a bank's activities. Ti er II's capital loss absorption capacity is \nlower than that of Tier I capital.  \n \nTrading Book A trading book or portfolio refers to the book of financial instruments held for the \npurpose of short-term trading, as opposed to securities that would be held as a \nlong-term investment. The trading book refers to the assets that are held primarily \nfor generating profit on short-term differences  in prices/yields. The price risk is the \nprime concern of banks in trading book. \n \nUnderwrite Generally, to underwrite means to assume a risk for a fee. Its two most common \ncontexts are: \na) Securities: a dealer or investment b ank agrees to purchase a new issue of \nsecurities from the issuer and distribute these securities to investors. The \nunderwriter may be one person or part of an underwriting syndicate. Thus the \nissuer faces no risk of being left with unsold securities.   \nb) Insurance: a person or company agrees to provide financial compensation \nagainst the risk of fire, theft, death, disab ility, etc., for a fee called a premium. \n \nValue at risk \n(VAR)It is a method for calculating and controlling exposure to market risk. VAR is a single number (currency amount) which es timates the maximum expected loss of \na portfolio over a given time horizon (the holding period) and at a given \nconfidence level\n.\nVega (\u03bd) The Vega of an option / a portfolio of options is the rate of change in the value of \nthe option / portfolio with respect to vo latility of the asset(s) underlying the \noption(s). \n \nVenture \ncapital Fund A fund with the purpose of  investing in start-up businesses that is perceived to \nhave excellent growth prospects but doe s not have access to capital markets. \n \nVertical \nDisallow-\nance In the BIS Method for determining regulatory capital necessary to cushion market \nrisk, a reversal of the offsets  of a general risk charge  of a long position by a short \nposition in two or more securities in the same time band in the yield curve  where \nthe securities have differing credit risks .  \n \n  238    \n \nANNEX  - 17 \n(Cf.

More than 6 million transactions were processed \nby the system during the month of January 2010 alone. The coverage has also increased substantially with the participation of over 63,000 bank branches spread across the length and breadth of the country.  \n \n2. NEFT uses the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to assure end-to-end security and the Indian Financial Network (INFINET) to connect bank branches for electronic transfer of funds. In line with the system capabilities and user expectations, a number of initiatives have been taken in the \nrecent past to extend operating hours, increase the number of batches and handle more transaction types. Incidentally, NEFT has no amount restrictions and accepts cash up to Rs. 50,000 for originating transactions.  \n \n3. With a view to further strengthen the NEFT system in terms of availability, convenience, efficiency and speed, the following refinements to process-flow and enhancements to operational features are being introduced \u2013  \n  \n(i) Tightening of Return Window  \u2013 Presently, the NEFT procedural guidelines mandate banks to \nreturn NEFT transactions in the very next av ailable batch. The NEFT system has, however, been \ndesigned to allow destination banks to return transactions on a T+1 basis. The traffic analysis has revealed that a major chunk of returns are effected by banks either in the last batch of the day or in the first batch of the next day, indicating that the transactions are processed by the destination batches only at the end of the day instead of batch-wise. In order to streamline the system and complete the processing cycle on a near-real-time basis, the concept of return within two hours of completion of a batch is being introduced. The B+2 return discipline would require banks to afford credit to beneficiary accounts immediately upon completion of a batch or else return the \ntransactions within two hours of completion of the batch settlement, if credits are unable to be \nafforded for any reason. Required changes in the SFMS / NEFT software has been carried out. Necessary changes are also being made to the Procedural Guidelines for the purpose. -2- \n(ii) Increase in Operating Hours  \u2013 NEFT is currently available from 9 am to 5 pm on week days \nand from 9 am to 12 noon on Saturdays.  Ther e have been constant requests from various \nindividual and business segments to elongate the operating hours. After examining the feasibility \nand customer benefits, it has been decided to extend NEFT operating hours from 9 am to 7 pm on week days and from 9 am to 1 pm on Saturdays. Member banks need to effect changes at their end to initiate and / or receive NEFT transactions taking full advantage of the increased hours of operation. \n \n(iii) Move to Hourly Settlements  \u2013 On date, NEFT has six batches of settlement at 9 am, 11 am, \n12 noon, 1 pm, 3 pm and 5 pm on week days and three batches of settlement at 9 am, 11 am and 12 noon on Saturdays. An analysis of daily data has shown that the volume of transactions processed in batches that have a gap of two hours between batches is double the volume of transactions processed in batches that have only an hour\u2019s gap between them. With a view to evenly space out transactions across batches, as also to make the system near-real-time, it has been decided to introduce the concept of hourly settlements. Accordingly, there would be eleven hourly settlements starting from 9 am to 7 pm on  all week days and five hourly settlements from 9 \nam to 1 pm on Saturdays. Necessary changes have been carried out in the SFMS / NEFT software.  \n \n(iv) Implementation of Positive Confirmation  \u2013 At present, the un-credited NEFT transactions are \nreturned by destination banks and it is presumed that credit for all other transactions have been afforded to beneficiary accounts. In order to remove any ambiguity and to introduce the element of positive confirmation, the NEFT outward message format is being modified to contain two additional fields, wherein mobile number and / or e-mail address of the originating customer can be populated. \nA new message format is also being introduced to relay to the originating bank an \nacknowledgement containing the date and time of credit, immediately after the credit is afforded to beneficiary accounts. This message would flow from the destination bank / branch to the originating bank / branch. The originating banks after receiving the positive confirmation from the destination banks shall have to initiate a mobile SMS or generate an e-mail to the originator to convey the fate \nof the transaction. Detailed process flow for gener ating the positive confirmation is enclosed. SFMS \n/ NEFT has been modified to add the required fields in the existing messages as also to handle the \nnew messages. \n \n4. The above modifications will be implemented in NEFT with effect from March 1, 2010. Member banks are advised to carry out appropriate changes to their CBS / system interfaces to handle the enhancements. In order to facilitate smooth migration, IDRBT-Hyderabad would release modified patches to be applied on SFMS / NEFT applications by February 15, 2010. For any additional information / clarifications, the NEFT team at y our bank can contact officials of DPSS or IDRBT \nthrough \nemail . \n \n5. Please acknowledge receipt and confirm completion of necessary arrangements.  \n \n \nYours faithfully, \n \n-Sd- \n \n(G Padmanabhan ) \nChief General Manager \nEncl. : Process flow for positive confirmation in NEFT Enclosure to letter DPSS.CO.EPPD.No.1687 /04.03.01/2009-2010 dated February 5, 2010  \n \nProcess Flow on Positive Confirmation in NEFT  \n \nThis document discusses the work flow to send a credit acknowledgement (N10) to the sender bank \nafter successfully crediting to the beneficiary account. On receiving the credit acknowledgement (N10) at the sender bank, SFMS at the sender bank should send an e-mail / SMS to the sender party (customer) about the successful transfer of the funds. \n \nThe process flow of credit confirmation based on CBS banks and non-CBS banks is as follows : \n \nA. CBS Implemented Banks  \n \n1. After successfully crediting the beneficiary account, CBS will send a Credit \nAcknowledgement (N10 message) to SFMS. On receiving the outward N10 message from receiver CBS, SFMS will update the status of respective transactions as \u201cCredited to Customer\u201d. The same outward Credit Acknowledgement (N10) will be sent to RBI Service centre (RBIP0NEFTSC). Outward N10 messages  may contain transactions of different \nbanks\u2019. \n2. On receiving N10 at RBI Service centre, NEFT segregates the N10\u2019s bank-wise and sends \nto corresponding sending / initiator bank\u2019s service centre through SFMS. \n3. At the bank\u2019s service centre, on receiving the inward N10 messages, corresponding \ntransactions will be updated with the transaction status as \"Credited to Customer\" and will send the inward N10 to CBS. Finally, SFMS will send credit confirmation to the customer through SMS / e-mail according to the details provided in the field SMS / e-mail of debit \ntransaction.  \nThe CBS branches are provided with the interf ace to receive the positive acknowledgement \nfrom their CBS in a STP manner. \n \nB. Non-CBS Banks  \n \n1. After successful crediting to the beneficiary account, the user in the beneficiary branch will \ninitiate a credit acknowledgement by clicking a button provided in SFMS. This will update the \nstatus of respective transactions as \u201cCredited to Customer\u201d. An outward N10 message is created and sent to his bank\u2019s service centre IFSC.  \n2. A new process in SFMS polls on database and consolidates the credit acknowledgements \nbased on the \u201cCredited to customer\u201d status and sends a new outward N10 message to RBI service centre. \n3. On receiving N10 at RBI Service centre, NEFT segregates the N10\u2019s bank-wise and sends \nto corresponding sending / initiator bank\u2019s service centre through SFMS. \n4. On receiving the inward N10 messages at Sending bank\u2019s service centre, NEFT will \nsegregate the N10 messages branch-wise and will send them to Gateway \u00c6 Sender branch \nIFSC. \n5. On receiving the inward N10 messages at Sender branch, corresponding transaction status \nwill be updated as \"Credited to the Customer\". Finally, SFMS will send credit confirmation to the customer through SMS / e-mail according to the details provided in the field SMS / e-mail of debit transaction.   \nThe destination banks / branches which are non-CBS may use the SFMS / NEFT screen to create the N10 messages by clicking the appropriate button, similar to creating the return messages.  \nThe originating bank will send the SMS / e-mail to the originator. \n \nThe SMS / e-mail will mention \u2013 \u201cNEFT Transaction with reference number 123456789 for Rs. \n999.99 has been credited on DD-MM-YYYY at HH:MM:SS\u201d. \n \nIt is also intended to initiate SMS and / or generate e-mail to be sent to the originator for negative acknowledgements \u2013 i.e., for those transactions returned without offering credit to beneficiary accounts. \n \nFor the modified / new message format, banks may approach officials of DPSS or IDRBT through \nemail .

Some of the salient features of the amendment, relevant to banks and financial institutions \nare as under: \n\u2022 Clause (ca) inserted in sub-rule (1) of Rule 2 defines \"non-profit organization\" \n\u2022 Clause (BA) inserted in sub-rule (1) of Rule 3  requires  banks/financial  institutions  \nto maintain proper record of all transactions involving receipts by non-profit organizations of value more than rupees ten lakh or its equivalent in foreign currency. \n\u2022 The amended Rule 6 provides that the records referred to in rule 3 should be maintained for a period of ten years from the date of transactions between the client and the banking company/financial institution. \n\u2022 A proviso has been inserted in sub-rule (3) of Rule 8, which requires that banks \n/financial institutions and its employees should keep the fact of furnishing suspicious \ntransaction information strictly confidential. \n\u2022 Rule 9, now requires banks/financial institutions to verify identity of the non-account based customer while carrying out transaction of an amount equal to or exceeding  2 \nrupees fifty thousand, whether conducted as a   single transaction or several \ntransactions that appear to be connected. \n\u2022 The amended sub-rule (1) of Rule 9, in terms of clause (b) (ii) requires verification of identity of the customer  for \nall international money transfer operations. \n\u2022 Proviso to Rule 9 (1) regarding the verification of identity of the client within a \nreasonable time after opening the account/execution of the transaction has been \ndeleted .  \n3. Accordingly, in view of amendments to the above Rules, banks / financial institutions are required to : \n(i) Maintain proper record of all transactions involving receipts by non- profit organizations of value more than rupees ten lakh or its equivalent  in foreign currency  and to forward a report to FIU-IND  of all such transactions in the prescribed format  every month  by  the 15th of the succeeding month. \n(ii) In case of transactions carried out by a non-account based customer, that is a walk-\nin customer, where the amount of transaction is equal to or exceeds rupees fifty \nthousand, whether conducted as a single transaction or several transactions that appear to be connected, the customer's identity and address should be verified.  Further, if a bank has reason to believe that a customer is intentionally structuring a \ntransaction into a series of transactions below the threshold of Rs.50, 000/- the bank \nshould verify identity and address of the customer and also consider filing a \nsuspicious transaction report (STR) to FIU-IND.  \n4.

Section III explains the \nstance of monetary policy and Section IV sp ecifies the moneta ry measures.  \n \nI. The State of the Economy \nGlobal Economy \n2. The global economy is  showing increasing sign s of stabilisation. The \ngrowth outlook in virtually  all economies is being revised upwards steadily, \nwith the Asian region expe riencing a relatively stronger rebound. Global \ntrade is gradually picking up, but other indicators of  economic activity, \nparticularly capital flow s and asset and commodity prices are more buoyant. \nHowever, even as most of the forecast s on recovery are generally optimistic, \nsignificant risks remain. The recovery in many eco nomies is driven largely \nby government spending, w ith the private sector yet to begin playing a \nsignificant part. There are signs that  high levels of global liquidity are \ncontributing to rising asset prices as  well as rising commodity prices. \nEmerging market economies (EMEs) are generally recove ring faster than \nadvanced economies. But th ey are also likely to face increased inflationary \npressures due to easy liq uidity conditions resulti ng from large capital \ninflows.  \n3. While conditions in th e beginning of 20 10 are significantly better than \nthey were at the beginning of 2009, a different set of policy challenges has \nemerged for both advanced  economies and EMEs. In  2009, while advanced \neconomies were focused on dealing with  the financial cr isis, especially \nreviving the credit market and restoring the health of the financial sector, \nEMEs were engaged in mitig ating the adverse impact of the global financial \ncrisis on their real econom ies. In 2010, the effort in advanced economies will \nbe to further improve the financing conditions and stre ngthen the growth \nimpulses, while the endeavour in the EMEs  will be to streng then the recovery \nprocess without compromisi ng on price stability and to contain asset price \ninflation stemming from large capital inflows. Domestic Economy  \n4. As stated in the Se cond Quarter Review of  October 2009, India's \nmacroeconomic context is different from that of advanced and other EMEs in \nat least four respects. One,  India is facing rising infl ationary pressures, albeit \nlargely due to supply side factors. Two, households, fi rms and financial \ninstitutions in India continue to have strong balance sheets , although there is \na need to encourage domestic consump tion and investment  demand. Three, \nsince the Indian economy is supply-con strained, pick-up in demand could \nexacerbate inflationary pressures. Four , India is one of the few large EMEs \nwith twin deficits - fiscal defi cit and current a ccount deficit. \n5. Growth during Q2 of 2009-10, at 7.9 per cent, reve als a degree of \nresilience that surprise d many. Subseque nt data releas es, whether on \nindustrial production, infrastructure or  exports, confirm th e assessment that \nthe economy is steadily gaining mo mentum. Based on this better-than-\nexpected performance, growth foreca sts for 2009-10 have  generally been \nrevised upwards. As reassu ring as this recovery is , it is still unbalanced. \nPublic expenditure continues to play a dominant role and performance across \nsectors is uneven, suggesting that reco very is yet to be come sufficiently \nbroad-based. \n6. For several months, rapidly rising  food inflation has been a cause for \nconcern. More recently, there are indicatio ns that the sustained increase in \nfood prices is beginning to  spill over into other commodities and services as \nwell. The increases in th e prices of manufactured goods have accelerated \nover the past two months . While food products, understandably, contribute \nsignificantly to this, pressures in othe r sectors are also visible. Further, \nprices of non-administered  fuel items have  increased significantly in line \nwith rising international prices. With growth accelerating in the second half \nof 2009-10 and expected to gain momentum over the next year, capacity \nconstraints could potentiall y reinforce supply-side in flationary pressures.  \n7. The inflation risk loom s larger when viewed in  the context of global \nprice movements. As already indicated, global commodity pr ices are showing \nsigns of firming up, driv en both by the recovery in demand and the asset \nmotive. Significantly, prices of impor tant food items are also firming up. \nGoing by the Food and Agri culture Organisation (FAO) data, the global rates \nof increase in the prices of sugar, cereals and edible  oils are now appreciably \nhigher than domestic ra tes. The opportunity to use imports as a way to \ncontain domestic food prices is , therefore, qu ite limited.  \n8. Monetary aggregates du ring 2009-10 have so fa r moved broadly in line \nwith their projections. However, non- food bank credit growth decelerated \nsignificantly from its peak of over 29 per cent in October 20 08 to a little over \n10 per cent in October 200 9. Thereafter, it recovered to over 14 per cent by \nmid-January 2010. This credit performanc e should be seen in the context of \nimproved access of corporat es to non-bank sources of  funds this year. Rough \ncalculations show that the total flow of financial resources from banks, \ndomestic non-bank and exte rnal sources to the commercial sector during 2009-10 (up to Janu ary 15, 2010) at Rs.5,89,000 crore was only marginally \nlower than Rs.5,95,000 crore in the corresponding period of the previous \nyear. These numbers sugges t that non-bank sources of finance have, to a \nlarge extent, mitigated th e impact of the slow down in bank credit growth. \n9. Our previous Reviews have comm ented on the monetary transmission \nduring the crisis period. While the changes in the Reserve Bank' s policy rates \nwere quickly transmitted to the money and government  securities markets, \ntransmission to the credit market was slower. Evidently, the transmission is \nstill in progress. The effective averag e lending rate of scheduled commercial \nbanks declined from 12.3 pe r cent in March 2008 to 11.1 per cent in March \n2009. Although relevant informatio n for the subsequent period is not \navailable, the effective average lendi ng rates may have de clined further as \nbanks' benchmark prime lending rate s (BPLRs) softened  by 25-100 basis \npoints during this period.  \n10. Financial markets have remained  orderly. Overnight money market \nrates remained below or close to the lo wer bound of the liquidity adjustment \nfacility (LAF) corridor. Li quidity conditions remained comfortable with the \nReserve Bank absorbing ab out Rs.1,09,000 crore on  a daily average basis \nduring the current financ ial year. Yields on gove rnment securities could \npotentially have increased  sharply because of th e abrupt increase in \ngovernment borrowings. However, the upward pressure  on yields was \ncontained by lower commerci al credit demand, open market operation (OMO) \npurchases and active liqu idity management by the Reserve Bank. Equity \nmarkets are behaving in a manner consiste nt with global patte rns. Real estate \nprices have firmed up as has been the trend in several other EMEs. Increasing \noptimism about the recovery and high le vels of liquidity ar e driving up real \nestate prices although they  are still some distance away from the pre-crisis \npeaks.  \n11. On the fiscal front, the stimulus by the government in  the second half \nof 2008-09 has clearly cont ributed significantly to the recovery. It may be \nrecalled that the crisis-dri ven stimulus by way of redu ction in excise levies, \ninterest rate subventions and additional capital expenditure came on top of \nstructural measures already built into  the budget such as the Sixth Pay \nCommission Award and farm debt waiver.  \n12. We will have to awa it the forthcoming budget in  end-February 2010 for \nthe Government's decision on phasing out the transito ry components of the \nstimulus. As regards the structural co mponents, even thou gh they were one-\noff, some of their impact  is expected to continue  over the next couple of \nyears, as state governments and pub lic sector enterp rises align their \ncompensation structures  with the recommendatio ns of the Sixth Pay \nCommission. \n13. Managing the government borrowing  programme to finance the large \nfiscal deficit posed a ma jor challenge for the Reserve Bank. In order to \naddress this, the Reserve Bank fro nt-loaded the gov ernment borrowing \nprogramme, unwound MSS securitie s and undertook OMO purchases.  14.  On the external front , exports have be gun responding to the revival in \nglobal demand. Right through the diff iculties of 2008-09 and the early \nmonths of the current fi nancial year, there was never any pressure on the \ncurrent account. However, capital outflo ws in the third qu arter of 2008-09 \nled to some stress on the balance of pa yments, but we rode this out on the \nstrength of our forex re serves. The Reserve Bank, however, had to initiate \nsome conventional and non-conventional measures to ease the pressure on \nforex and rupee liquidity. In the space of a year, the situation has clearly \nstabilised.  \n15. The current account deficit during April-Sept ember 2009 was US$ 18.6 \nbillion, up from US$ 15.8 bi llion during April-Septembe r 2008. Over the first \nhalf of 2009-10, capital inflows resumed, but were no t significantly in excess \nof the current account deficit. India's improving growth pr ospects, combined \nwith persistently high levels of global  liquidity, may result  in a significant \nincrease in net inflows over the comi ng months. Depending on how these are \nhandled, there will be im plications in terms of a combination of exchange \nrate appreciation, larger  systemic liqui dity and the fi scal costs of \nsterilisation. \n \nII. Outlook and Projections \nGlobal Outlook \n Global Growth \n16. Global economic performance impr oved during the third and fourth \nquarters of 2009, prompti ng the IMF to reduce the pr ojected rate of economic \ncontraction in 2009 from 1.1 per cent ma de in October 2009 to 0.8 per cent in \nits latest World Economic  Outlook (WEO) Update released on January 26, \n2010. The IMF has also revised the projection of gl obal growth for 2010 to \n3.9 per cent, up from 3.1 per cent (T able 1). The IMF ex pects the growth \nperformance, which will be led by major Asian economies, to vary considerably across coun tries and regions, refl ecting different initial \nconditions, external shocks, and policy responses. \n \nTable 1: Projected Global GDP Growth (%)* \n Country/Region 2009 2010 \nUS (-) 2.5 2.7 \nUK (-) 4.8 1.3 \nEuro Area (-) 3.9 1.0 \nJapan  (-) 5.3 1.7 \nChina  8.7 10.0 \nIndia 5.6 7.7 \nEmerging and Developing Economies 2.1 6.0 \nWorld (-)0.8 3.9 \nSource: World Economic Outlook Update, IMF, January 26 . 2010  \n \n \n \n \n \n 17. The IMF has also revised upward s its projection of the real GDP \ngrowth of emerging and developing econ omies for 2009 to 2.1 per cent from \nits earlier number of 1.7 pe r cent. The estimates are ev en more optimistic for \n2010. The growth of emergi ng and developing economies is now projected at \n6.0 per cent, up from 5.1 per cent earlier. The growth in EMEs such as China \nand India and other emerging Asian ec onomies is expected  to be robust. \nCommodity-producing countri es are likely to recover quickly in 2010 on the \nback of a rebound in commodity prices. \n Global Inflation \n18. The IMF expects that the high leve ls of slack in re source utilisation \nand stable inflation expecta tions will contain global inflationary pressures in \n2010. In the advanced econo mies, headline inflation is  expected to increase \nfrom zero in 2009 to 1.3 per cent in 2010, as rising  energy prices may more \nthan offset deceleratio n in wage levels. In emerging and developing \neconomies, inflation is e xpected to rise to 6.2 pe r cent in 2010 from 5.2 per \ncent in 2009 due to low slack in reso urce utilisation an d increased capital \ninflows. \nDomestic Outlook \n Growth  \n19. During 2009-10, real GDP growth acce lerated from 6.1 per cent in Q1 \nto  \n7.9 per cent in Q2 driven  by revival in industrial  growth, and pick-up in \nservices sector growth, ai ded by payment of arrears arising out of the Sixth \nPay Commission Award. It is expected that Q3 growth, which will reflect the full impact of the deficient south-we st monsoon rainfall  on kharif crops, \nwould be lower than that of Q2. As rabi  prospects appear to be better, on the \nwhole, agricultural GDP grow th in 2009-10 is expected to be near zero.  \n20. As a result of the improvement in  the global economic situation since \nthe Second Quarter Review in October 2009, exports expand ed in November \n2009, after contracting for 13 straight months. This positive trend is expected \nto persist. The industrial sector recove ry, some signs of wh ich were noted in \nthe Second Quarter Review, is now c onsolidating. The performance of the \ncorporate sector has pick ed up. Increased business optimism also reflects \nbrighter prospects for the industrial sector. Services  sector activities have \nimproved. Domestic and international financing conditions have eased \nconsiderably, and this too sh ould support domestic demand.  \n21. In the Second Quarter Review of  October 2009, we  had placed the \nbaseline projection for GDP growth for 2009-10 at 6.0 per cent with an upside bias. The movements in the latest  indicators of real sector activity \nindicate that the upside bias has materialised. Assuming a near zero growth \nin agricultural production and continued recovery in industrial production and services sector activity, the baseli ne projection for GDP  growth for 2009-\n10 is now raised to 7.5 per cent (Chart 1). \n  \n \n22. Looking ahead to  2010-11, our preliminary a ssessment of the baseline \nscenario is that the curr ent growth will be sustained. This  is a tentative \nassessment. We shall formal ly indicate our growth projection for 2010-11 in \nour Monetary Policy in April 2010.  \n Inflation \n23. Headline wholesale price index (W PI) inflation was 1.2 per cent in \nMarch 2009. It continued to decline and became ne gative during June-August \n2009 due to the large statistical base e ffect. It turned po sitive in September \n2009, accelerated to 4.8 pe r cent in November 2009  and further to 7.3 per \ncent in December 2009. On  a financial year basis, between April-December \n2009, WPI moved up by 8 per cent.  \n24. The deficient monsoon rainfall and drought cond itions in several parts \nof the country have accentuated the pr essure on food pric es, pushing up the \noverall inflation rate \u2013 both of the WPI and consum er price indices (CPIs). \nGoing forward, the rabi crop prospects are assessed to be better. The large \nstock of foodgrains with public agencies should he lp supply management. On \nthe other hand, there is a risk that in flationary pressures may emanate from \nthe rebound in global  commodity prices.  \n25. Assessment of inflationary pressu res has become increasingly complex \nin the recent period as the WPI and CPI inflation rates have shown \nsignificant divergence. All the four CPIs  have remained elevated since March \n2008 due to the sharp increase in esse ntial commodity prices. The Reserve \nBank monitors an array of measur es of inflation, both overall and \ndisaggregated components, in conjuncti on with other economic and financial \nindicators to assess the underlying infl ationary pressures for formulating its \nmonetary policy stance.  26. The Second Quarter Review of October 2009 projected WPI inflation \nof 6.5 per cent with an upside bias for end-March 2010. The upside risks in \nterms of higher food pr ices reflecting poor monsoon have clearly \nmaterialised. However, some addition al factors have also exerted upward \npressure on WPI inflation. One, the ex pected seasonal mo deration has not \ntaken place, other than in vegetables. Two, prices of the non-administered \ncomponent of the fuel group, tracking the movement in global crude prices, \nhave also risen significan tly. Three, there have also been some signs of \ndemand side pressures. The Reserve Ba nk's quarterly inflation expectations \nsurvey for households indi cates that inflation expe ctations are on the rise. \nKeeping in view the global trend in  commodity prices and the domestic \ndemand-supply balance, the baseline projection for WPI inflation for end-\nMarch 2010 is now raised to  8.5 per cent (Chart 2). \n \n \n27. As with growth, we shall formal ly announce our inflation projection \nfor 2010-11 in our Mone tary Policy in April 2010. However, on the \nassumption of a normal m onsoon and global oil pric es remaining around the \ncurrent level, it is expected that inflat ion will moderate fr om July 2010. This \nmoderation in inflation w ill depend upon several factors, including the \nmeasures taken and to be  taken by the Reserve Bank as a part of the \nnormalisation process. \n28. As always, the Reserv e Bank will endeavour to  ensure price stability \nand anchor inflation expectations. The conduct of monetary policy will \ncontinue to condition and c ontain perception of inflation in the range of 4.0-\n4.5 per cent. This will be  in line with th e medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India\u2019s broader inte gration with the global \neconomy. \nMoney and Credit Aggregates \n29. During the current financial year , the year-on-year growth in money \nsupply (M 3) moderated from over 20.0 per cent at the be ginning of the \nfinancial year to 16.5 per cent on Janua ry 15, 2010, reflecting deceleration in \nbank credit growth duri ng 2009-10. Year-on-year increase in non-food bank \ncredit to the commercial s ector, at 14.4 per cent as  on January 15, 2010, was \nsignificantly lower than the 22.0 per ce nt growth a year ago. Consequently, \nthe more important source of M 3 expansion this year ha s been bank credit to \nthe government, reflecting the enlarged support to the market borrowing of \nthe government and unwind ing of MSS securities. \n30. Aided by the measures initiated by  the Reserve Bank (see para 13), \nover 98 per cent of the net market  borrowing programme of the Central \nGovernment for 2009-10 has already b een completed by January 28, 2010. \nThe anticipated increase in credit de mand by the commercia l sector in the \nremaining period of 20 09-10 can, therefore, be easi ly met from the market as \nadequate liquidity is av ailable in the system. In view of the increased \navailability of funds from  domestic non-bank and external sources (see para \n8), the 18 per cent  growth in adjusted non-foo d credit growth projected \nearlier is unlikely to be realised. Accordingly, the indicative adjusted non-\nfood credit growth projection for 20 09-10 is now reduced to 16 per cent. \nBased on this projected cr edit growth an d the remaining very marginal \nmarket borrowing of the go vernment, the projected M 3 growth in 2009-10 \nhas been reduced to 16.5 per cent for policy purposes. Cons istent with this, \naggregate deposits of scheduled commerc ial banks are project ed to grow by \n17 per cent. These numbers, as before, are provided as indicative projections \nand not as targets. \nRisk Factors \n31. While the baseline scenario is co mforting, a number of  downside risks \nto growth and upside risks to inflation need  to be recognised. \n(i) There is still uncertain ty about the pace and sh ape of global  recovery. \nThere are concerns that it is too de pendent on public spending and will \nunravel if governments ar ound the world withdraw  their fiscal stimuli \nprematurely. As the world discovered  during the recent crisis, the \nglobal economy is heavil y inter-linked th rough the busi ness cycle. A \ndownturn in global sentiment will a ffect not only our external sector \nbut also our domestic investment. \n(ii) Oil prices have been range-bound in the recent period . However, if the \nglobal recovery turns out to be st ronger than expected, oil prices may \nincrease sharply, driven  both by prospects of demand recovery and the \nreturn of the investment motive, which will affect  all commodities. This could stoke inflationary pressu res even as grow th remains below \npotential.  \n(iii) Expectations of so ftening domestic inflation are contingent on food \nprices moderating. This, in tu rn, depends significantly on the \nperformance of the south-west m onsoon in 2010. If rainfall is \ninadequate, high food prices will continue to intensify inflationary \npressures.  \n(iv) So far, capital inflows have been absorbed by th e current account \ndeficit. However, sharp increase in capital inflows, above the \nabsorptive capacity of the econom y, may complicate ex change rate and \nmonetary management. \n(v) As growth accelerates and the ou tput gap closes, excess liquidity, if \nallowed to persist, may exacerbate inflation expectations. \n \n32. Beyond the above risk factors, by far a bigger risk to both short-term \neconomic management a nd to medium-term econom ic prospects emanates \nfrom the large fiscal deficit. The co unter-cyclical public finance measures \ntaken by the government as part of the crisis management were necessary; \nindeed they were critical to maintain ing demand when other drivers of \ndemand had weakened. But as the recove ry gains momentum, it is important \nthat there is co-ord ination in the fiscal and mone tary exits. The reversal of \nmonetary accommodation cannot be effective unless there is also a roll back of government borrowing. As indica ted earlier (para 13), even as the \ngovernment borrowing had increased ab ruptly during 2008- 09 and 2009-10, it \ncould be managed through a host of measures that bolstered liquidity. Those \nliquidity infusion  options will not be available to the same extent next year. \nOn top of that, there will be additional constraints. Inflatio n pressures will \nremain and private credit demand will be  stronger with the threat of crowding \nout becoming quite real.  \n33. There are standard, well-known an d well-founded reas ons for fiscal \nconsolidation. For both short-term ec onomic management and medium-term \nfiscal sustainability reason s, it is imperative, theref ore, that the government \nreturns to a path of fiscal consolidat ion. The consolidation can begin with a \nphased roll back of the transitory comp onents. Beyond that, in the interest of \ntransparency and predictability, the governme nt should ideall y do two things: \nfirst, indicate a roadmap for fiscal c onsolidation; and second, spell out the \nbroad contours of tax policies and expe nditure compression that will define \nthis roadmap. \n \nIII. The Policy Stance  \n34. The Reserve Bank has pursued an accommodative monetary policy \nbeginning mid-September 2008  in order to mitigate th e adverse impact of the \nglobal financial crisis on the Indian eco nomy. The measures  taken instilled \nconfidence in market participants and helped cushion the spillover of the global financial crisis on to our economy. However, in  view of rising food \ninflation and the risk of  it impinging on inflat ionary expectations, the \nReserve Bank announced the first phase of exit from the expansionary \nmonetary policy by te rminating some sector-speci fic facilities and restoring \nthe statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks to its pre-\ncrisis level in the Second Quar ter Review of October 2009.  \n35. Against the above backdrop of global and domestic macroeconomic \nconditions, outlook and risks,  our policy stance in this  Quarter is shaped by \nthree important considerations: \n(i) A consolidating recovery should enco urage us to clearly and explicitly \nshift our stance from 'managing the crisis' to 'managin g the recovery'. \nWe articulated this ch ange in our stance in  the October quarterly \nreview, but the growing confidence in the recovery justifies our \nmoving further in revers ing the crisis-d riven expansionary stance. Our \nmain policy instruments are all curre ntly at levels that are more \nconsistent with a crisis situation than with a fast-recovering economy. \nIt is, therefore, necessary to carry forward the process of exit further. \n(ii) Though the inflationary pressu res in the domes tic economy stem \npredominantly from the supply si de, the consolidating recovery \nincreases the risks of these pressures spilling  over into a wider \ninflationary process. Looking ahea d into 2010-11, if the growth \nmomentum turns out to be as expected, pressu res on capacities in an \nincreasing number of sectors are likely to strengthen the transmission \nof higher input and wage costs into product prices. \n(iii) Even amidst concerns  about rising inflation, we must reme mber that \nthe recovery is yet to fully ta ke hold. Strong anti-inflationary \nmeasures, while addressing one probl em, may precipitate another by \nundermining the recovery , particularly by deterr ing private investment \nand consumer spending. \n \n36. Against this backdrop, the stance of monetary polic y of the Reserve \nBank for the remaining period of 2009-10 will be as follows: \n\u2022 Anchor inflation expectations an d keep a vigil on the trends in \ninflation and be prepared to resp ond swiftly and effectively through \npolicy adjustments as warranted.  \n\u2022 Actively manage li quidity to ensure that cr edit demands of productive \nsectors are adequately met cons istent with price stability.  \n\u2022 Maintain an interest ra te environment consiste nt with price stability \nand financial stability, and in supp ort of the grow th process.  \n \n \n IV. Monetary  Measures \n37. On the basis of the current as sessment and in line with the policy \nstance as outlined in Section III, the Rese rve Bank announces the following \npolicy measures: \nBank Rate \n38. The Bank Rate has been retained at 6.0 per cent. \nRepo Rate  \n39. The repo rate under th e Liquidity Adju stment Facility (LAF) has been \nretained at 4.75 per cent. \nReverse Repo Rate \n40. The reverse repo rate under the LAF has been retained at 3.25 per cent. \nCash Reserve Ratio \n41. It has been decided to:  \n\u2022 increase the cash reserve ratio ( CRR) of scheduled banks by 75 basis \npoints from 5.0 per cent to 5.75 per cent of th eir net demand and time \nliabilities (NDTL) in two st ages; the first stage of increase of 50 basis \npoints will be effective the fort night beginning Fe bruary 13, 2010, \nfollowed by the next stag e of increase of 25 basi s points effective the \nfortnight beginning February 27, 2010. \n42. As a result of the incr ease in the CRR, about Rs . 36,000 crore of excess \nliquidity will be absorbed from the system. \n43. The Reserve Bank will  continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, \nparticularly the price situ ation closely and take further action as warranted. \nExpected Outcomes \n44. The expected outcomes of the actions are: \n(i) Reduction in excess liquidity will help anchor inflationary \nexpectations. \n(ii) The recovery process will be supported without compromising price \nstability. \n(iii) The calibrated exit will align policy instrume nts with the current and \nevolving state of  the economy.  \nMonetary Policy 2010-11 \n45. The Monetary Policy for 2010-11 will  be announced on April 20, 2010.  \n \nMumbai \nJanuary 29, 2010 ", "source": "https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/TQRAPJAN2010.pdf"}, {"title": null, "date": "Jan 28, 2010", "info": "Ref.No.IDMD / 3315 /08.02.033/2009-10                                       January 28, 2010  \n    \nAll Scheduled Commercial Banks / \nAll State Co-operative Banks/All Scheduled Primary  \n(Urban) Co-operative Banks /All Financial Institutions/ \nAll Primary Dealers  \n \nDear Sirs, \n \nAuction of Government of  India Dated Securities  \n  \nGovernment of India have offered to sell (re-i ssue) of  (a) \u201c7.02 percent  Government \nStock 2016 \u201d for a notified amount of Rs.3,000 crore (nominal) through a price based \nauction  using uniform price method  vide Notification No.4(1)-W&M/2009 dated \nJanuary 28, 2010, (b) \u201c6.35 percent Governm ent Stock 2020\u201d for a notified amount of \nRs.3,000 crore (nominal) through a price based auction  using uniform price method  \nvide Notification No.4(1)-W&M /2009(i) dated January 28, 2010 and (c) \u201c8.24 percent \nGovernment Stock 2027\u201d for a notified amount of Rs. 2,000  crore (nominal) through \na price based auction  using uniform price method  vide Notification No.4(1)-\nW&M/2009(ii) dated January 28, 2010.

Under the arrangements, there is a transfer of funds by accepting bank to its \ncorrespondent bank and it is an obligation of the correspondent bank to honour the instruments. \nHowever, such transfer of funds and obligation of  correspondent bank to honour the instruments in no \nway absolve the primary liability of the accepting ban k issuing drafts and interest/dividend warrants to \nits customers. It is, therefore, advised that all RRBs should reckon the liability in the following manner: \ni)        When an RRB accepts funds from a cli ent under its remittance facility scheme, it becomes a \nliability (Liabilities to Others) in its books. The liability of the RRB ac cepting funds will extinguish only \nwhen the correspondent bank honours the drafts iss ued by the accepting bank to its customers. As \nsuch, the balance amount in respect of the dra fts issued by the RRB on its correspondent bank \nunder the remittance facility scheme and remaining unpaid should be reflected in the RRB\u2019s books \nas an outside liability and the same should also be taken into account for computation of NDTL for \nCRR/SLR purpose. \nii)        The amount received by correspondent ba nks has to be shown as ' Liabilities to the Banking \nSystem ' by them and not as ' Liabilities to Others ' and this liability could be netted off by the \ncorrespondent banks against their inter-bank assets. Likewise sums placed by banks issuing \ndrafts/interest/duplicate warrants are to be treated as Assets within banking system in their books \nand can be netted off from their inter-bank liabilities.  \n2.
